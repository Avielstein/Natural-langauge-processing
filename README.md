# NLP Project Collection

Welcome to my collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects. This repository contains various projects exploring different facets of NLP, from text analysis and sentiment detection to language generation and beyond.

## Updated Projects

#### 1. Asynchronous OpenAI API Interaction Tutorial

This document serves as a guide for interacting with the OpenAI API asynchronously, focusing on practical examples and configurations for effective usage. It's tailored to facilitate users in environments like Jupyter Lab, emphasizing the GPT-3.5-turbo model and asynchronous execution patterns.

#### 2. BERTopic - Advanced Topic Modeling**  
BERTopic leverages state-of-the-art transformer models and class-based TF-IDF to generate dense clusters of topics for comprehensive and interpretable text analysis. This section of the repository showcases the application of BERTopic on a dataset, illustrating its capabilities in uncovering meaningful topics within large text corpora. The project emphasizes BERTopic's adaptability in handling various sizes of datasets and its efficiency in topic modeling processes.

##### Key Highlights of the BERTopic Project:
- Utilization of ðŸ¤— transformers for generating document embeddings.
- Application of class-based TF-IDF to enhance topic specificity and relevance.
- Exploration of different topic modeling techniques supported by BERTopic.
- Visualizations of topic distributions and hierarchies for enhanced interpretability.
